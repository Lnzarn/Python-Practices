Chapter 82: A Rewarding Harvest, the First Vein, Treasure Hunting (4700 words)

  The cave dwellers kept climbing out of the mud pit for over twenty minutes before finally stopping.

  Looking around, the area was packed with people—over 300 of them!

  

  Lier's spirits soared at this sight.

  300 people meant 300 laborers!

  And they were naturally suited for digging—born with the divine physique for mining.

  All treasures to be claimed.

  Her gaze swept the crowd, immediately spotting one cave dweller taller and more robust than the rest.

  The instant she locked eyes with him, his attribute panel appeared in her mind.

  Unexpectedly, he was a hero unit.

  Already at Level 3.

  Its hero talent was intriguing—

  Caveman Expertise—When commanding cavemen, all cavemen's stamina recovery speed increases by 30%, and digging speed increases by 20%.

  This was absolutely perfect!

  Not using them for mining would be a waste of their potential!

Lier pondered, turning her gaze toward the cave dweller hero.

Her psychic energy surged forth, leaving a faintly pale imprint on its soul.

  A Level 3 Caveman Hero—his soul strength still couldn't match that of a Wetland Lizardman Warrior.

  Even so, imprinting him left her feeling slightly overloaded.

  Her eyes grew a bit dizzy.

  It took her a while to recover.

  Taking a deep breath, he waved his hand to halt the swamp banshee's chant.

As the song faded, the dazed cave dwellers slowly came to.

But the next instant, a chill gripped their bones, sending shivers down their spines.

  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw hundreds of fierce lizardmen staring at them coldly.

Those brutal, emotionless, icy eyes resembled a pack of wolves on the hunt.

Many cave dwellers couldn't withstand the pressure, collapsing uncontrollably to the ground.

  Some trembled violently, kneeling directly to prostrate themselves, their heads pressed to the ground in the most abject submission.

  “We beg for mercy!”

  “Honored Lord, I pledge my service! Spare my life!”

  “Merciful and mighty being, my life is worthless. I beg you to forgive our sins.”

  “.”

  The cries for mercy rose and fell in an unending chorus.

  The terror in their words was utterly unmasked.

  So cowardly?

Lier's lips twitched, though inwardly he felt relieved.

He didn't need these cave dwellers as warriors. Cowardice was easier to control—stubborn, fearless lizardfolk would be a headache.

  As he pondered, his gaze fell upon the cave-dweller hero in the center—his forehead glistening with sweat, his face a mask of terror.

Feeling Lier's stare, the man instinctively knelt, his voice firm.

“Great Overlord, we obey your command.”

  “All cavemen are willing to serve you!”

Lier nodded with satisfaction.

“Very well. I prefer dealing with intelligent beings.”

His gaze fixed intensely on the cave hero.

“Tell me your name.”

  The other lifted his head slightly and declared loudly.

  “Thorn, salutes you!”

  “Thorn? Rise. Come closer—I have questions.”

  The cave-dweller hero cautiously stood and hurried forward.

  “Great Overlord, your command.”

Lier gestured toward the ground beneath them.

“I need the iron ore beneath us mined. Can you manage it?”

The cave-dweller hero nodded.

“Master, excavation is our natural gift!”

  “Even the hardest ore cannot withstand our sharp claws!”

  His tone carried a hint of pride.

  Lier glanced at his exceptionally thick arms and the peculiar, claw-like appendages—clearly born for digging.

  She smiled warmly.

  That's exactly how it should be.

  After a moment's thought, she continued.

  “What do you normally eat?”

  This place wasn't exactly close to Dawnveil City, and sustaining them with the territory's resources would be a bit of a strain.

  Ideally, like the Delsa people, they could subsist on plant roots and tubers—self-sufficient provisions requiring no effort on his part.

Torn immediately replied.

“The underground teems with insects and unique subterranean flora.”

“And no one competes with us for it!”


"

  Her tone was quite excited.

  Lier found it rather amusing. Competition was low underground, so you all burrowed into the earth. I suppose that counts as blazing a new trail, right?

  The theory of life evolution.

  “Can this area sustain all the cavemen?”

“Yes, we only need to hunt for one to two hours each day.”

Lier's mood lifted considerably.

If they could support themselves, he wouldn't need to provide logistics.

That would save a lot of energy and resources.

  “How much ore can you mine daily?”

“We tried burrowing nests inside before. Though iron ore is tough, each of us can mine at least 300 kilograms daily!”

Lier had never mined and lacked a benchmark to judge this figure.

  But with over 300 members, even using 300 kg per person would yield 90,000 kg daily—that’s 90 tons of ore?!

  That figure should be pretty good.

  I’ll ask Bain about this. The Swamp-Folk hero should know.

  “Thorn, can you command your kin?”

“Great Overlord, half of them are my offspring! They obey my commands absolutely!”

Half are your offspring?

Lier glanced at the vast, dark mass of cavemen.

His mouth twitched.

  You sure can reproduce.

“Very well. I appoint you as Chief Executive of Dawnveil City Mines. Lead the cavemen and extract iron ore.”

“Pile the mined ore on the surface. I'll come collect it weekly.”

  Pausing to consider, he waved his hand, summoning a dozen swamp wasps from the sky.

“These are swamp wasps. Weave a cage later and use the insects to raise them.”

“If danger arises, release them. They'll return to deliver the message.”

  “I'll lead my army to rescue you!”

Life hidden underground didn't require much concern for their safety.

Unless it was a Bog Witch, enslaving them might not be so straightforward.

  The moment they sensed threat, they'd burrow underground. Unless one could follow suit, there was nothing to be done but watch helplessly.

The earth itself was the ultimate shield.

Thorn gazed at the swamp wasps as if they were precious treasures, his voice brimming with excitement.

  “Yes, Great Overlord! Your will is supreme!!”

This was a lifeline.

His chest instinctively puffed out. From now on, they—these lowly subterranean creatures—had acceptance and a patron!!

Praise the goddess!!

  Lier smiled, glancing down at the ground.

  The only thing troubling him was that Dawnveil City currently lacked the capability to smelt steel.

  Even if they mined the ore back, it would likely take ten days or half a month before it could be used.

  Upon returning, she must begin constructing a blacksmith's forge.

Just then, Thorn spoke softly.

“Great Sovereign, may I share the good news of your acceptance of our allegiance with my kin?”

Lier chuckled.

  So you're actually happy about mining for me?

  Innate Divine Ox-Horse Physique?

  “Go ahead.”

  With permission granted, Thorn immediately turned and approached the trembling cave dweller, who stood before the cold stares of the swamp lizardfolk.

  He proclaimed loudly.

“The Great Sovereign has just accepted our allegiance!”

“Henceforth, we shall be protected by the Sovereign's grace and guarded by warriors at our side!”

“My people, we are no longer alone!!”

  The cave dwellers below erupted into a stir, staring at their hero in disbelief.

Could it be true? That someone would accept these lowly creatures, who scraped out a miserable existence in the caverns, afraid even to gaze upon the sun?

And by a faction boasting so many powerful swamp lizard warriors?

  All eyes shot straight toward the cave-dweller hero, while simultaneously stealing cautious glances at Lier, as if seeking confirmation.

Noticing the cave-dwellers' gazes, Lier strode forward, positioning herself behind Thorn. Her imposing gaze swept across the crowd.

Endless divine might surged forth from within her.

  The cavemen felt a chill run through their bodies, their blood freezing.

Thud~ Uncontrollably, they all collapsed to the ground, trembling.


Trembling.

  It was an oppressive force emanating from the depths of their bloodlines, a terror that pierced the soul. Even dragons would bow their heads before it—these lowly creatures could offer no resistance.

  Beneath that towering presence, a voice as calm and weighty as mountains slowly echoed.

  “In the name of Dawnveil City's Lord, Master of the Muddy Marshes, I accept your allegiance. From this day forward, all cave dwellers shall become my subjects, laboring for me.”

“I shall provide you with food and clean water, and ensure your safety.”

  “This marshland shall fall under the rule of Dawnveil City. Work diligently for me, and no one shall ever bully you again.”

“Furthermore, every week, I shall reward those who work hard by allowing them to visit Dawnveil City for a holiday and witness the great theater.”

The cave dwellers erupted into a wave of excited commotion.

  Feeling the surging aura of power, their terror mingled with exhilaration!

Truly, this mighty human lord was willing to accept their allegiance and even offer them protection!!

For the weak cave dwellers, even living underground left them severely lacking in security.

  Gaining the protection of a powerful being felt like an injection of adrenaline into their souls.

Their sense of security surged dramatically.

Seeing this, Lier slowly retracted his imposing aura.

He had only been here to lend prestige to this cave-dweller hero; henceforth, the hero would be the one to manage these subordinates.

  Ignoring the still-exuberant subterranean creatures, she turned her gaze to the equally excited cave-dwelling hero beside her.

  “Thorn, are there any powerful beings in this vicinity?”

  He shook his head, a hint of shame in his voice.

  “Master, we've always lived underground. We know little of the world above.”

When encountering enemies, their first instinct was to hide—burrowing deep into the earth. Why would they ever venture out to see who it was?

The earth itself was their ultimate refuge!

Lier wasn't surprised. That was just how cave dwellers were.

  Returning to the main topic.

“Do you need tools to mine the veins?”

“Our claws are the best tools we have!”

The cave dweller hero spoke with a hint of pride—perhaps the only thing they could truly boast about.

Lier smiled and said nothing more.

  He simply instructed Thorn to send the cave dwellers down to begin mining.

Thus, he secured Dawnveil City's first mineral vein while also gaining a sufficient workforce.

The cost to him was virtually nothing—these cave dwellers didn't even require him to provide food.

  Workers who bring their own provisions? Nice.

With that settled, he turned to today's second objective—

The magical beast carcass buried 30 kilometers west of the domain. It could boost Hargus's potential to 3 stars!

  Lier pondered briefly before summoning 100 cavemen to accompany the army.

When it came to digging pits, few could match their expertise.

The cavemen followed, a mix of excitement and trepidation evident.

  After assigning Thorn to handle logistics, Lier wasted no time and led the army away.

March continued.

Guided by the magical map, navigation proved straightforward.

After roughly half an hour, the Wetland Lizardmen scouts ahead relayed news—enemy contact detected.

  Having hunted numerous times, the army had now developed a well-rehearsed response protocol.

  Upon detecting enemies, they would thoroughly assess the enemy's numbers and strength whenever possible.

  If the enemy proved formidable, they would immediately retreat to relay the intelligence, avoiding alerting the foe prematurely.

  Then, with lightning speed, all intelligence was consolidated and relayed to Lier, who made decisions based on the intelligence.

The entire process was efficient, direct, and smooth as silk.

When Lier arrived at the front, he immediately saw giant insects—four meters long, over a meter tall, with gray-black, hard-shelled skin covered in moss.

  These caterpillar-like creatures were gnawing at the aquatic plants below in the muddy water.

Seeing these unsettling creatures, he immediately recalled the ancient swamp life form—

  the Mudworm.

  That little creature, once thumb-sized, had now grown as thick as an arm. Its days consisted solely of eating mud or sleeping.


Awakening.

  These days, it felt utterly insignificant. At this rate, it would take a long time to recover, gnawing away at the mud for ages.

  Focusing intently, the attributes of those insects appeared in its mind—Swamp Worms, Level 6, Potential 2 stars.

  Their level wasn't high, and there were only about fifty or sixty of them. Yet seeing such large insects writhing in the filthy mud was rather disgusting.

Lier instinctively glanced at the Swamp Witch.

“Begin.”

  Mmm~ Mmm~

A soft, melodic chant filled the air. Under the astonished gazes of the cave dwellers behind them,

one by one, the terrifying swamp worms stiffened as if stripped of their souls, their bodies rigidly crawling toward this direction.

Their hearts were filled with dread.

  No wonder they crawled out of the ground for no reason. It was all due to these nymphs' power.

  Thankfully the Overlord accepted them, or else... each shuddered at the thought.

  The swamp insects closed in swiftly, but the Bubble Beast's bubbles couldn't contain them. They were simply too massive.

  They couldn't be silently executed like other creatures.

Lier's spikes showed no mercy.

She ordered the Wetland Lizardmen to stand four or five beside each one. Once ready, she waved her hand to signal the execution.

Steel blades and sharp claws swung in unison.

  Terrifying agony struck, jolting the insects from their song. They tried to resist.

But in the next instant, heads were severed, brains torn apart.

Blood spurted everywhere~

Two or three that weren't instantly killed perished in the second wave of attacks.

  They had no time to resist.

Lier glanced at the swamp succubi once more.

These creatures were incredibly useful.

With them present, combat efficiency skyrocketed to absurd levels.

The true reaping of flesh and blood was faster than harvesting wheat.

  Must cultivate them. Cultivate them intensely.

  After the battle, the Bubble Beasts deftly inflated their bubbles, stuffing every swamp insect inside.

  Just two or three swamp insects could completely fill a bubble, their plump bodies packed without a single gap.

  Each of these Level 8 magical creatures controlled over five bubbles.

They transformed into a transport convoy, gathering all the spoils.

Continuing onward, they encountered another monster gathering spot—a group of filthy boar-men.

  Their numbers exceeded two squadrons.

  Unexpectedly, however, these boar-men proved immune to the swamp banshee's song.

  When the song sounded, the boar-men remained utterly still, as if it were music to deaf ears.

  These swamp creatures were quite novel.

  Lier wasted no time.

  He immediately ordered the three squadrons of Wetland Lizardmen Warriors in his command to launch an attack.

  Hargus charged ahead.

  With superior numbers and levels,

  they swiftly slaughtered the entire group.

  But the boar men were truly ferocious. No matter how heavy their casualties, they didn't retreat a single step.

After slaughtering them all, the Bubble Beast's bubbles increased to 80, averaging 10 per person.

Their expressions were no longer relaxed.

  The bubbles no longer soared skyward but dropped directly to the ground, rolling forward.

Bubble Beast could control up to 30 bubbles, but air bubbles and bubbles filled with loot were entirely different matters.

Still, gazing at the overflowing spoils, Lier felt quite satisfied.

  “Kill and plunder, and you'll be rich”—there was some truth to that saying. External raids could accumulate vast wealth in a short time.

  However, this wasn't sustainable. The monsters they killed wouldn't magically reappear the next day; they needed time to reproduce and repopulate.

  As the territory gradually expanded, relying solely on hunting to meet demands would become unrealistic. Ultimately, farming would be the solution to the domain's development needs.

But that didn't stop him from making a fortune first.

  Finally, at two in the afternoon, they reached the location indicated by the intelligence—an area covered in crimson flowers, the burial ground of the beasts.

After confirming the location was correct, he wasted no time and immediately ordered the cave dwellers to begin digging.

This area spanned two to three hundred meters in diameter.

  Finding a corpse of unknown size at an unknown depth underground presented a significant challenge.

  If he had sent Wetland Lizardmen warriors to dig, it would likely take three to five days just to make a discovery.

  But now, he had the Cavemen.

  All he needed to do was wait for these...


The humanoid excavators got right to work.

  Watching the bustling crowd, Lier's mood brightened considerably.

  Being a lord was truly delightful—this kind of manual labor could be handled by subordinates with just a single command.




Chapter 83: The Mysterious Bronze Coffin, Metamorphosis (5200 words)

  The excavation posture of the cave dwellers was quite eye-catching.

  Their thick arms possessed immense strength. When digging, their bodies would bend slightly to better leverage their power.

  Their front claws possessed a unique structure; when wielded with immense force, they could effortlessly tear through the earth.

As the claws swung backward, clods of soil flew in a steady stream.

  Digging diagonally downward into the ground, within mere minutes the cave dwellers vanished from sight. Only the continuous spewing of earth from the hole remained visible.

  This book is exclusively premiered online by 𝕥𝕨𝕜𝕒𝕟.𝕔𝕠𝕞

  Extremely efficient.

These peculiar subterranean creatures possessed unique respiratory methods, allowing them to breathe freely even within cramped tunnels without fear of suffocation.

Hundreds of humanoid excavators sprang into action. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, an hour later—the surface was ravaged beyond recognition in the blink of an eye.

  The once-blooming expanse of red flowers lay in utter ruin.

  Two full hours passed since noon, yet as the sun began its descent toward the western horizon, the beast's carcass remained elusive.

  Every inch within a 20-meter radius had been thoroughly searched.

  Nothing.

Lier strained her senses to the limit, yet detected no trace.

If it wasn't in the shallow layers, then deeper excavation was the only option!

She steeled herself for the time-consuming task ahead.

But then, out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of Hargus standing guard nearby.

  A thought flickered in her mind. Hoping for a breakthrough, she summoned him and stated directly.

  “Hargus, the beast corpse buried below holds the key to your advancement. Try sensing it—see if you can detect its location.”

  The Wetland Lizardman Hero nodded solemnly.

“Yes, Master!”

He slowly closed his eyes. A roaring surge of vital energy erupted from his body, blazing like flames across his skin.

  His mental senses strained to their limit, scanning the surroundings.

Moments later, his eyes snapped open. Pointing in a specific direction, his voice brimmed with excitement.

“Master, I sense it!!”

“Right in that area, buried about fifty meters underground!”

It actually worked?!

  Lier's spirits soared, and he immediately prepared to order the cave dwellers to concentrate their digging efforts.

But before he could give the command, a commotion erupted among the nearby cave dwellers.

They shouted excitedly, “We found it! We found it!”

  She glanced at the lizardman hero. Hadn't he sensed it? How could they already be digging?

Hargus's face flushed with embarrassment. Had... his senses failed him?

  He quickly turned to investigate.

A large group of cavemen had gathered, frantically digging in one direction.

Dirt flew everywhere as they worked with astonishing speed, like scooping rice from a bin.

  Within ten minutes, over a hundred cavemen working in unison had unearthed a massive pit.

Then, a flood of people poured down into it. Exclamations echoed from below as they strained to haul something up.

Lier stood nearby, brimming with excitement.

What form would that beast's corpse take?

  Moments later, her expression shifted slightly.

  Now, the cave dwellers below had begun surfacing, gradually climbing out of the deep pit. What they had unearthed was slowly revealed—but it wasn't the expected monster corpse.

  Instead, it was a rust-stained bronze coffin, engraved with strange patterns that sent an inexplicable chill down one's spine.

Lier's face was filled with question marks.

“I told you to find a corpse, and you go and rob a tomb on me?”

  With the cave dwellers working together, they soon hauled out the massive coffin, measuring 5 meters long and 3 meters wide.

Under the sunlight, the rust-stained bronze hue appeared even more ancient, its mysterious patterns saturated with the traces of history.

  It exuded an aura of mystery, grandeur, and sanctity.

Furrowing her brow slightly, Lier focused her gaze. Unexpectedly, the intelligence system in her mind displayed only the most basic information—

Mysterious Bronze Coffin

???

  ???

  Merely a name prefixed with “Mysterious,” followed by nothing but question marks.

  Her gaze sharpened.

  She immediately stepped forward, halting within thirty meters.

  Summoning the swamp deity's essence suppressed within her magic vortex, a divine might as vast as the starry sky surged forth, enveloping the bronze coffin.

  The next instant, the coffin began to tremble violently.




  Like it's... afraid?!

  This coffin is afraid?!

  Is there something alive inside?

Lier felt a slight shock.

But after trembling for a few breaths, the coffin quickly settled back into stillness. No matter how fiercely his divine might surged, it showed no reaction.

It was as if it had all been a mere illusion, as if nothing had ever happened.

  This coffin absolutely concealed something.

While pondering, he waved for the cavemen to open it, but they searched the coffin for a long time without finding any cracks.

  Finally, the cave dwellers' leader stepped forward helplessly and whispered.

  “Great Master, this coffin is cast as a single piece. There is no place to open it.”

  Lier waved his hand, signaling them to cease their efforts.

  His consciousness drifted outward, attempting to probe inside.

But the coffin stood like a mountain, blocking all perception.

No matter how hard he strained, he couldn't penetrate its thick barrier.

In the end, he had no choice but to give up.

  What on earth was hidden within this thing?

The more he couldn't probe it, the more his curiosity grew.

The only reassuring thing was that he sensed no threat emanating from the coffin. Instead, he could faintly perceive a trace of fear radiating from the bronze casket toward him.

  After a moment's thought, he waved for Hargus to resort to brute force.

  “Try breaking it open!”

  Hargus immediately complied, advancing with a steel blade in hand.

  His arm muscles bulged instantly as he gripped the blade tightly, channeling all his strength into the strike.

  Whoosh~

  The blade swung down with brutal force, striking the coffin with a heavy thud.

  Sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

  That seemingly fragile bronze felt like an indestructible heavy shield. Not even a dent remained.

“So sturdy!”

Lier's eyes shifted again.

Force won't work either?

Still unwilling to give up, she waved for the swamp succubus beside her to try.

  The succubus wasted no time, chanting for a long while, yet achieved nothing.

The coffin remained unmoved, not even a flicker.

It was as if their songs had lost their soul-stirring charm, just like when facing the boar-men.

  Seeing this, Lier could only abandon the attempt for now.

“Take it back first. We'll study it thoroughly at the domain.”

He immediately ordered the cavemen and Hargus to dig up the magical beast's corpse while he continued observing, hoping to discern some clue.

  Half an hour later, the cavemen erupted in a clamor once more, finally unearthing a desiccated giant lizard carcass from the earth.

  It was remarkable that it had dried out underground in the swamp instead of rotting.

  Finding nothing worthwhile, Lier temporarily abandoned the search and approached the corpse.

  The moment he drew near, he felt its surging energy.

  It had been dead for who knows how many years, yet its energy remained so potent.

No wonder Hargus had sensed it—this was a giant lizard.

Even desiccated, its former terror was still faintly discernible. Its body alone stretched six meters long.

  And this was its shrunken state.

Hargus was now overcome with excitement.

“Master.”

This was yet another opportunity for advancement.

The last time had been over a month ago!

Both times, it was power bestowed upon him by the Master.

  His eyes burned with fervor.

He would devote everything he had to serve the Sovereign!!

Lier smiled with satisfaction.

“Carry this corpse and the bronze coffin back.”

Glancing at the darkening sky,

  She didn't send the cavemen back to the iron mine; instead, she had them follow the army back to the territory.

  About thirty cavemen hoisted the bronze coffin, while seven or eight carried the desiccated lizard corpse.

  They immediately began their return journey.

  As dusk deepened, everyone quickened their pace.

This unexplored region yielded two wild monster lairs on the return journey.

Lier couldn't be bothered with unnecessary complications. With a wave of her hand, the swamp wasps behind her surged forward like a tidal wave.

  They instantly overwhelmed the enemies.

The battle lasted no more than three minutes before the swamp lizardmen picked up the corpses and departed.

  After two waves, they gained over a hundred more corpses as spoils.

Rushing back, they reached the territory only after night had fallen completely.

The residents had already finished their evening meals.

Bain


Hearing the commotion outside, he immediately led men out to greet them.

“Good evening, my lord.”

He spoke, then glanced with surprise at the cave dwellers carrying the bronze coffin.

New laborers?

What is this bronze coffin?

  Lier waved his hand.

  “Have someone take the cave dwellers down for dinner first.”

  “Today we discovered an iron ore vein outside. Over 300 cave dwellers live nearby. I've subdued them. From now on, the cave dwellers will be our miners.”

  “Tomorrow we'll take them to mine iron. Tonight they rest.”

  His gaze drifted toward the bronze coffin behind him.

  “Do you know what era these patterns belong to?”

  “My lord... I... I know little of ancient civilizations.”

  Bain smiled bitterly. He was merely a Swamp-Folk; becoming a hero had consumed his entire life's effort. Even if he wished to learn such knowledge, there was nowhere to study it.

“This coffin was unearthed by the cave dwellers. Take it to the Swamp Treants for safekeeping. There may still be life within.”

  Bain's heart sank.

  What kind of being could possibly survive inside a coffin buried underground for who knows how long?

  His tone grew solemn.

  “Yes, sir.”

  Lier said no more, turning his attention to the adorable little creature beside him.

“Bubo, take the corpses you’re carrying to the swamp treefolk area. I’ll make arrangements shortly.”

After the little creatures departed, Lier signaled to the wetland lizardmen warriors.

  “Take all the corpses you're carrying → east, to the area where the young lizards are held.”

The beast corpses had been found. Next, Hargus would be promoted upon transitioning to a Coldblooded Cavalryman, simultaneously activating his dual talents.

  This would grant him another formidable combat asset.

The greater the strength at his command before the Authority manifested, the more confidence he would possess.

A cascade of orders was issued, and everyone sprang into action.

  Lier accompanied the swamp lizardmen, carrying the bloody corpse to the area where the young lizards were raised.

The young lizard, previously half a meter long, had now grown to over a meter in length, standing sixty to seventy centimeters tall.

  Their front legs had undergone complete mutation, no longer bearing the weight of locomotion. Long, sharp claws now sprouted from them, transforming into fearsome weapons.

The burden of supporting their bodies was now entirely shouldered by their hind legs.

Both hind limbs had grown exceptionally thick and sturdy, planting themselves firmly on the ground.

  Having devoured all the corpses it had been fed, its amber eyes now scanned the surroundings with hungry intensity.

Upon spotting Hargus's arrival, it immediately approached with excitement.

It extended its barbed tongue to lick and press against him.

  Hargus stroked its head with satisfaction, then extended his right hand. Sharp claws slashed his palm, blood dripping wildly.

  The small lizard opened its mouth wide, catching every drop and gulping it down greedily.

  Only when the fury within him began to surge did Hargus stop.

  Lier, witnessing this, waved for the nearby swamp lizardmen to toss over the corpses of the beasts.

  Hundreds of bodies instantly piled up into a small mountain.

  The lizard let out a joyful cry and charged straight in to feast.

  As if starved for over ten days, the frenzied feeding was jaw-dropping.

Then came a startling sight.

As it ate, its body began visibly growing and bulking up.

  Like a balloon being inflated.

Hargus watched, his eyes flashing with excitement.

“Master, it has tapped into the power deep within its bloodline! With sufficient sustenance, it will transform into a Swift Lizard tonight!”

  Lier's eyes brimmed with anticipation.

Was the first cold-blooded cavalryman about to be born?

He gestured toward the desiccated lizard carcass lying nearby.

“Devour it. Complete your transformation alongside the Swift Mad Lizard.”

  “Yes, Master!”

Hargus showed no hesitation, striding forward to sit cross-legged before the shriveled lizard.

His vital energy surged forth, enveloping the corpse radiating colossal power.

  The next instant, his body trembled as a force as overwhelming as collapsing mountains surged into him.

Instantly filled to bursting with energy, every tendon and muscle bulged.

Ah!!

Hargus


Caught off guard, a beastly growl erupted from his throat, the agony twisting his face into a hideous grimace.

This transformation was far from smooth sailing.

  Beside him, the ferocious lizard sensed the agony of its blood-bound master and let out a low growl of its own.

It buried its head, devouring the flesh on the ground with even greater fury.

A faint, elusive connection began to form between the two.

  Lier stationed troops around them to prevent any disturbances.

Seeing no immediate changes, he turned his attention to the swamp treant.

The corpses transported back by Bubo were now piled beside the flesh-devouring beast.

  But without his command, they remained untouched.

Lier instructed Bubo, who hadn't yet departed, to move the swamp insect corpses aside as a precaution.

As a hero unit, Hargus required immense energy for his transformation.

  Especially with the dual enhancements from his Coldblooded Cavalry class change.

  Keeping a backup plan ensured they could handle any unexpected developments with composure.

  While the little one busied himself, he turned his gaze to the Swamp Treant.

  “Bring forth the Mosquito Queen. Feed her corpses. I require 200 units of blood essence.”

The swamp treant curled beneath its trunk, its roots slowly extending like fingers unfurling.

Exposed lay the Mosquito Queen—wings and legs shattered, roots piercing her flesh, holding her firmly captive.

  This ferocious creature had become nothing more than a production tool.

A living ore capable of endlessly producing blood essence.

The swamp tree man used roots to propel her forward while another set of roots scooped up corpses from the ground. The mosquito queen's mouthparts pierced through flesh and bone.

  Its mouthparts secreted a unique corrosive solution, swiftly dissolving the corpses into bloody slurry.

  In a subconscious feeding frenzy, within mere breaths, flesh and bone were devoured clean.

  After feeding on twenty to thirty corpses, it yielded over two hundred pieces of blood essence.

  Feeling the surging life energy, Lier finally felt somewhat reassured.

With the task complete, she waved for the swamp treant to stow away the Mosquito Queen.

The roots immediately retracted, layer by layer, completely enveloping the Mosquito Queen within the tree's roots.

It was then placed back at the base of the trunk.

  From the outside, there was no hint that a ferocious Level 13 lifeform was imprisoned within.

As long as the Swamp Treant remained alive, the Mosquito Queen would never escape its grasp.

  Lier snapped back to attention, her gaze shifting to the conspicuous bronze coffin nearby.

She pointed toward the swamp treant.

“You five shall bind this coffin with your roots and guard it day and night.”

  “Without my command, none of you may touch it.”

The five swamp trees closest to her, having been addressed, immediately thrust their roots from the ground.

  They then jointly lifted the bronze coffin, slowly retreating it to the central area. The five swamp treants intertwined their roots to completely envelop the bronze coffin.

  It then slowly sank back into the earth.

  Other roots stirred the soil to cover the ground once more.

  Thus, the bronze coffin vanished without a trace.

Lier's mood lifted slightly at this sight.

These swamp treants had previously been inconspicuous, but now it seemed their immobility offered significant advantages.

They had effectively become Dawnveil City's physical prison and treasure vault.

  No other location could offer the security of these treasures being bound by roots.

Interestingly, the swamp tree imprisoning the Mosquito Queen had recently shown a noticeable surge in vitality.

It had drawn considerable power from within the Mosquito Queen.

  At this rate, it might not be long before it undergoes an upgrade—a welcome bonus.

These 3-star potential beings possess a level cap as high as 12.

If all reach their peak, they would form a formidable force. Using them as jailers and treasure guardians would be most convenient.

  After calming his emotions, he glanced once more at the Swamp Queen Bee, who had been in a deep slumber for several days.

  After sustaining damage to her very essence, he had forcibly sustained her with dozens of healing spells. Now, she was still recovering, showing no signs of awakening in the near future.

  Shaking his head, he dismissed further thoughts and waved for the corpses left for the Flesh Slaughterer to be fed entirely to this divine being.

In an instant, it devoured everything.


Afterward, the sensation of hunger returned once more.

  But he could sense that the flesh-devouring beast's emotions were even more pronounced now.

  The feeding had yielded remarkable results; the fruits of the hunt had not been wasted.

  In high spirits, he ordered Bubo to load the remaining corpses and return to the ferocious lizard devouring flesh.

In the mere twenty minutes since his departure, seven or eight of the hundred corpses had already been consumed.

  Its body had visibly grown by two full sizes.

The pace of its transformation was nothing short of absurd.

By the time Bubo hauled over fifty to sixty corpses of four-meter-long swamp worms, Lier felt confident.

Just you wait and see how much you can devour!

  Two hours later, the Swift Mad Lizard's shoulder height had grown to an absurd two meters!

Its skin was wrinkled like ancient tree bark, its eyes filled with frenzied savagery.

Its front claws curved like razors, while its thick hind legs planted firmly on the ground.

  Now, this ferocious beast slowly extended its head toward the swamp insect carcasses, beginning to devour them in large chunks.

Lier watched this, taking a deep breath.

It seemed... the situation had shifted slightly. This Swift Mad Lizard's appetite was more outrageous than he'd imagined.

  Over a hundred corpses were devoured in an instant.

And it still wasn't enough!

Watching its relentless consumption, anticipation rose in his eyes.

  How powerful could a unit become after devouring such vast quantities of flesh?

As night deepened, he didn't rest. He watched from the sidelines as the Velociraptor consumed forty swamp insects!

By dawn, its shoulder height had surpassed three meters.

  Finally, at this moment, it reached its limit.

The Velociraptor roared to the heavens, then strode over to the still-sleeping Hargus. It lay down slowly beside him, cradling him in its embrace before sinking into a deep slumber.

  A strand of vital energy quietly extended from Hargus, enveloping the Swift Mad Lizard within its embrace.

Both began a profound transformation.

 


Chapter 84: The Wasteland Grave Keeper, the Green Grass Granny (4800 words)

As the surging energy continued to be devoured by Hargus, the withered lizard corpse gradually shattered into dust, until it finally dissolved into a pile of debris.

  The lizardman hero's face contorted in agony, the colossal energy threatening to tear him apart.

The pain that ripped through flesh and soul could not be escaped, even with his innate immunity to suffering.

  Hargus roared, his body convulsing as he collapsed slowly onto the Swift Fierce Lizard, his head resting deliberately or inadvertently upon its heart.

Vital energy blazed like fire, enveloping both beings within its flames.

  His eyes slowly closed, his breath agitated, and he fell into a deep slumber.

Had this transformation befallen anyone else, even the two-headed ogre chieftain, the outcome would likely have been dire.

Seeing this, Lier retrieved the blood essence the Mosquito Queen had just produced.

  She placed it near them, just within reach of the surging qi and blood.

Then, with evident delight, she observed the blood essence enveloped by the fiery qi, gradually evaporating and shrinking.

It transformed into energy, surging into his body.

  The pace wasn't particularly swift, clearly indicating his energy absorption capacity was nearing saturation.

Still, something was better than nothing. Perhaps this extra bit of energy could push him over the final hurdle.

After watching for a long while and confirming Hargus wouldn't complete his transformation anytime soon, Lier didn't linger.

  After instructing the surrounding Wetland Lizardmen to maintain strict vigilance and forbid any disturbances, he turned and returned to his tent.

Occupying the mineral vein, enslaving the cave dwellers, discovering the unexpected bronze sarcophagus underground, and finally facilitating Hargus's transformation.

  After a day of relentless activity, he felt a measure of weariness.

  Yet completing these two intelligence missions had proven immensely profitable.

  Possessing his own iron ore meant future weapons, armor, and daily necessities would all be secured.

Moreover, the cave dwellers served as self-sustaining miners—requiring little effort on his part, only waiting for the harvest.

  For Hargus, this meant gaining a powerful 3-star hero who would activate a second talent during his transformation.

He would even transition into the legendary lizardman unit—the Coldblooded Cavalry.

  With all these advantages piling up, he eagerly anticipated the immense power he would wield upon awakening.

Lier needed to grow as strong as possible by August 14th, when the Authority would appear. Then, he would face that Level 15 Flying Dragon head-on!

  After washing up, he lay down to rest, faintly hearing the swamp sirens rehearsing nearby.

These magical lifeforms possessed unique constitutions, requiring no human-like rest. They sustained themselves by consuming a mere trace of emotions each day.

This allowed them ample time for nightly rehearsals.

  Theater was both a performance and a means to grow stronger.

Lier paid it little mind, soon drifting into a deep sleep.

On the morning of the 21st, his first act upon waking was to check on Hargus. Both the hero and his own Swift Mad Lizard remained asleep.

  Their postures hadn't shifted.

  Yet he could distinctly sense their vital energy had markedly surged.

  Surrounding lizardfolk kept glancing this way, unease filling their eyes as if guarding a dragon poised to awaken at any moment.

  At this rate, perhaps by nightfall, they would complete their transformation.

His gaze relaxed.

Without lingering, he immediately summoned his troops.

Today's objective was the second piece of intelligence—

  35 kilometers southeast, amidst a reed bed, dwelled a group of swamp creatures—Grass Grandmas. They were exceptionally skilled at tending plants and shared a connection with the Vine Fairies.

  Their 3-star value spoke volumes.

  Lier brought two Vine Fairies along for this mission.

  Since these Green Grass Grannies were connected to those plump little creatures, having them communicate might yield better results.

  Three squadrons of Wetland Lizardmen, 50,000 Mud Swamp Wasps, Bubble Beasts, Swamp Sirens, plus two Vine Fairies.

  Fully armed.

  We had standard combat warriors, high-attack-power assassins with low health, ranged support mages, mind-bending sorcerers, and Lier as the healer.

This was the ideal setup for clearing dungeons.

The two-headed ogre chieftain Ett remained behind to guard the territory and protect the still-slumbering Harg.


The troops assembled and set out immediately.

As his exploration expanded, the intelligence system's coverage extended further into the marsh's outlying areas.

A 35-kilometer round trip meant 70 kilometers total. They had to push forward relentlessly; otherwise, a few skirmishes along the way would cost them precious time.

  Life in the swamp became more active after dark, significantly increasing the danger.

He was unwilling to take excessive risks before gaining complete control of the swamp.

When first entering the swamp, everything seemed novel, but after over half a month, Lier had grown accustomed to the scenery and pushed forward relentlessly.

  Two hours later, ten kilometers beyond the territory's borders, the Mud Swamp Wasps ahead transmitted a message: Unknown enemy detected!

Lier's gaze sharpened as he immediately led his troops forward.

After advancing roughly a kilometer, a vast expanse of muddy wasteland came into view, sparsely covered only by scattered weeds.

  Beyond the mud, a group of strikingly familiar creatures came into view.

Huge, curved, forked horns grew from their heads, covered in vibrant green moss.

Their bodies were covered in delicate plum-blossom-like patterns, dappled and intricate.

  Their eyes were jet-black, large, and alert. All these creatures now lifted their heads, motionless, studying them.

Their eyes darted about, a mix of wariness and curiosity.

Swamp Giant Antler Deer!

Lier recognized these creatures immediately.

  They had encountered these creatures upon first arriving in the marsh, the very day they obtained the Vine Fairy.

  Never expected to meet them again.

  His gaze immediately scanned the herd.

  Where was that 4-star potential, Level 12 Giant Antler Deer King?

  Its majestic form had left a deep impression on him.

Scanning the herd, he quickly spotted the target.

At the rear of the giant antler deer pack, a massive stag towering significantly above the others stared intently at them.

  Its shoulder height now exceeded three and a half meters!

  Like a colossal statue.

  The last time he encountered it, its shoulder height had barely reached three meters.

  Focusing his gaze, he saw its attribute panel—the level had risen to 13!

  Last time it was only Level 12. In just half a month, this stag king had grown even stronger!

The Swamp Giant Antler Stag King now noticed Lier's gaze. After fixing its eyes on him for a moment, it cautiously lifted its head to glance at the dark swarm of Mud Swamp Wasps filling the sky.

  Over fifty thousand swarm together, forming a terrifying black tide.

No one would want to face an insect swarm of this scale.

Lier gave the stag a long, hard look, then decisively waved his hand, leading his troops away.

No guarantee.

  A Level 13 hero, with that dazzling array of attributes—even 50,000 swamp wasps charging at him wouldn't be enough to make a dent.

Especially his innate ability—the power to become ethereal, granting complete immunity to physical damage and reducing magical damage by 70%.

  That's practically invincibility.

Compared to earlier encounters, even mosquito queens of the same level couldn't hold a candle to this.

We'll just have to grow stronger and return another day.

But deep down, he was brimming with confidence.

  Half a month ago, when he first encountered the Swamp Stag, he had only a few wetland lizardmen warriors and vine fairies by his side—a handful of creatures, big and small.

Now, the power he commanded had increased tenfold, if not more.

In another month or two, the tide of battle would surely turn.

  He left the area and quickened his pace.

  After about twenty minutes of travel, a sudden roar of lizardmen echoed—

  Enemy attack!

  Lier's heart skipped a beat as he immediately sped up.

  Upon arrival, he found the scouting swamp lizardman standing pale and bloodless in the distance, staring fixedly at one spot.

Lier focused his gaze.

  A group of translucent monsters, each wielding a curved scythe and radiating a sinister blue glow, floated midair.

  They emitted a death energy that made one's heart tremble.

  These were unique undead beings—

  Specters!

  These undead drifted above a circular grave overgrown with weeds, spanning over ten meters in diameter.

Their faces turned toward his location.

Desolate Grave Guardians

【Level】: 9
【Potential】: 3 Stars

  【Race Talent】: Undead Specters, born within desolate graves. After death, they can be reborn within the same desolate grave.


Alive.

  【Skills】: Ethereal Form (2-star) – Immune to 90% physical damage, capable of passing through solid objects.

  Soul Scythe (2-star) – The scythe in its hand can directly attack an enemy's soul.

  【Evaluation】: They were born to guard the tombs of certain powerful beings.

  Level 9 Necromancer?!

  Lier took a deep breath, studying its innate talent intently—Undying Specter.

  After death, it could resurrect within its tomb.

  This was the most perverse racial talent he had encountered thus far.

  Moreover, there was no limit on the number of resurrections. This meant the enemy could keep coming back endlessly!

  Sensing their approach, countless ghostly spirits began drifting out from the overgrown circular graves.

  Over three hundred souls crowded the view.

Lier's scalp prickled at the sight of the densely packed undead.

He waved his hand, ordering his troops to retreat immediately.

Over three hundred in number, high-level, capable of resurrection, and worst of all—immune to 90% of physical damage.

  What was the point of fighting?

Even if they cleared these undead, there was still that unassuming-looking tomb below.

Who knew what was buried inside?

The desolate grave guardians, wielding scythes and glowing an eerie blue, silently watched their retreat without moving.

  Only when they were nearly out of sight did they drift one by one into the tomb. In the blink of an eye, not a single specter remained.

Only the overgrown, weed-covered mound stood waiting for the next unsuspecting outsider to approach.

  Leaving the area, the army pressed forward.

  Half an hour later, they encountered the second group of wild beasts—a herd of Minotaurs with horns protruding from their skulls.

  Their bodies were robust, each standing over two meters fifty tall.

  They bellowed wildly.

  Their hides were exceptionally thick and coarse.

  Though formidable, the Minotaurs possessed no immunity to physical damage.

  Lier saw this and immediately ordered the entire army to charge.

  The troops surged forward like a tidal wave.

  Bubble Beasts created explosive bubbles to disrupt formations, Swamp Sirens used their songs to disorient the minotaurs, Wetland Lizardmen warriors charged head-on, and Mud Swarm Wasps swarmed down from the sky like arrows.

  Under the combined assault of all forces, the buffalo men were overwhelmed before they could react.

  Amidst agonized roars, they fell one by one.

  Their thick hides couldn't withstand the mud wasps' stingers, nor the claws and steel blades of the swamp lizardmen.

  Surveying the field strewn with corpses, Lier's mood finally eased.

He waved his hand, signaling the Bubble Beasts to gather the bodies.

Gazing at the carnage before him, his thoughts returned to the Barren Grave Guardians. The emergence of these spectral guardians had raised his vigilance.

  He must find a way to command a powerful mage legion in the future.

When physical damage proved ineffective, he could still rely on additional means.

Though the Bubble Beasts were extraordinary, their role remained largely functional.

Bubble Bomb was their sole magical damage skill.

  Compared to orthodox mages, they still fell a bit short.

After clearing the battlefield, the march continued.

This area was particularly dense with wild monsters, and they soon encountered three more gathering spots.

All were annihilated under Lier's blade, becoming bounty within bubbles.

  By midday, Lier unfolded the magical map and scanned the surroundings.

  Surrounded by lush, sprawling reed beds, he waved for the army to halt.

  His mood was exhilarated—they had arrived!

  The vine fairy perched on his shoulder flapped her wings and took flight.

  Circling around him.

  Her face held a mix of curiosity and confusion.

  “Father God, there's a familiar aura here. Have we been to this place before?”

  Her large, dark eyes held confusion, and paired with her chubby cheeks, this fist-sized little fairy was indescribably adorable.

Lier was utterly charmed.

She chuckled softly.

“Do you know Old Lady Green Grass?”

Old Lady Green Grass?

  The two vine fairies exchanged glances before shaking their heads in unison.

  “No idea~”

  “Never heard of her.”

  With the fall of the Swamp God, many of the beings he had created had vanished. The bonds between them had long since faded under the erosion of time, no longer as close as they once were.




  Some spend their entire lives unaware that there are others like them—creatures born from the Swamp God.

“Grass Grandma is similar to you,”

The Vine Fairy's eyes still held a trace of bewilderment.

Lier gazed at the reeds ahead, her gaze flickering.

  If she shared a connection with the Vine Fairy, could she be subdued just as easily?

After a moment's contemplation, Lier strode forward.

Divine might surged from her body, enveloping the area.

Rustling~

  A vast flock of birds was startled from the reeds.

  Their terrified cries echoed far and wide.

  After the birds scattered, the scene fell abruptly silent.

  In the blink of an eye, the reeds within began swaying, gradually reaching outward.

  Lier silently watched it all unfold, her anticipation reaching its peak in that moment.

Splash~

The foremost reeds parted,
and a peculiar figure slowly emerged from the thicket. It gazed at Lier with curiosity, excitement, and disbelief.

  It seemed to want to approach, yet feared mistaking her identity.

  Standing barely five feet tall, its hair wasn't ordinary human hair, but was instead covered in reeds.

  Fluffy and mottled white, it seemed a breeze could scatter vast clouds of dandelion-like seeds.

  The face was deeply wrinkled, the pale silver eyes radiating kindness.

  The body was hunched, appearing profoundly aged.

  She wore a long, yellowed skirt made of reed leaves, cut in a style befitting an elderly woman.

  Overall, she resembled an ordinary grandmother from next door.

  “Father God... is it you?”

  Her voice trembled slightly, yearning to acknowledge him yet filled with fear.

  Seeing this, Lier's suspended heart suddenly settled.

“It is I. I have returned.”

Grass Grandma

【Level】: 8
【Potential】: 3 stars
【Magic Power】: 2200

  【Racial Talent】: Spirit-Bestowing—Can imbue plants with sentience and communicate with spirit-possessed flora.

  【Skills】: Root & Sprout (2 stars)—Accelerates plant rooting and germination.

  Reviving Breeze (2 stars)—Restores withered plants to vitality.

  Miraculous Hand (2 stars) has a chance to upgrade low-level magical plants to higher tiers.

  【Evaluation】：A unique lifeform created by the Bog Goddess using the power of the Creator God.

  Grass Grandma's attributes are equally peculiar, all centered around plant cultivation.

  Not a single one is useless.

  Unlike the Vine Fairy, whose effects are limited to Starlight Vines, the Green Grass Grandma's skills work universally across all plant types.

  Especially the two soul-infusing abilities: one grants plants sentience, while the other enhances low-quality magical plants. These two skills are practically unbeatable.

  Feeling the warmth radiating from his soul, the Old Grass Lady burst into tears, choking back sobs as she approached him.

“Father God, we have waited for you for hundreds of thousands of years!”

Generation after generation, the wait had been unbearably long.

  Upon seeing the Old Grass Lady, the Vine Fairy also approached with warmth.

A sudden intuition prompted her to call out instinctively.

“Old Lady~”

The Old Grass Lady looked up reflexively. Seeing the Vine Fairy, her tears flowed even more fiercely.

  “Have you found the little fairy?”

All doubt vanished. She knelt instantly, bowing in the most humble posture.

“Father God~”

At that moment, the intelligence system in her mind silently displayed new information.

  [You have found the swamp-exclusive lifeform—Grass Grandma. Having gathered two swamp-exclusive lifeforms, you gain an additional piece of intelligence—When the Swamp Authority appears, bringing the Vine Fairy and Grass Grandma will greatly benefit your control over the Authority.]

Lier's mood instantly lifted.

  “How many companions do you have left?”

  “Have them all come out. We're returning to Dawnveil City now—this is our new home.”

  Dawnveil City?

  The name made Green Grass Granny's body tremble, her tears flowing even more fiercely.

  The great Father God, ever mindful of restoring the marshes.

  “Father God, counting me, we are nine in total.”

  A 3-star intelligence report yielded only nine individuals—proof of the Green Grass Grandmother's invaluable worth.

  Lier's spirits soared.

  “Let's go home!”

These


Production units are no less vital to farming and domain development than powerful combat units.

They form the very foundation and bedrock of a domain's rise.

 


Chapter 85: Domain Under Attack, Demigod Creation—Plague Flies (5200 words)

Soon, all the Green Grass Grannies emerged from the reeds. The nine women bore striking resemblances in both attire and appearance.

The long reed hair growing from their heads was particularly eye-catching.

  With tears in their eyes, they bowed to Lier before turning their affectionate gaze toward the Vine Fairy, showering the little creatures fluttering around her with indulgent care.

  This book is exclusively premiered on 𝕥𝕨𝕜𝕒𝕟.𝕔𝕠𝕞

  Joy nearly overflowed from their hearts.

  They had finally found their tribe.

  The great Father God had awakened, and the Swamp Clan would surely reclaim its former glory.

  Praise the Swamp!

  After confirming the Green Grass Grannies had nothing else to carry, Lier made no further delay and set off immediately to return to the domain.

  The journey back felt far more relaxed than the trip there.

  The objective was secured. Now came the task of assimilating this unique harvest, integrating these distinct beings into Dawnveil City.

  Lier did not retrace his steps but veered slightly off course, leading his troops to search uncharted territories.

  The results were evident. By evening, when they returned to the domain, they had added over two hundred more monster corpses to their tally.

  As Dawnveil City grew stronger, its sphere of influence expanded rapidly.

  The wild monsters near the territory had dwindled significantly. It was foreseeable that in the near future, the entire swamp would echo with only one voice.

By then, hunting as effortlessly as today would become difficult. Venturing beyond the swamp into the wilderness could easily take three to five days round trip.

  This was an inevitable consequence of territorial expansion.

The most comfortable approach remained steady farming and development. Once the breeding numbers of the three-tailed boars increased, such arduous journeys would become unnecessary.

Upon returning to the territory, Bain, the chief administrator, came running to greet him.

  “Good evening, my lord.”

Lier nodded, his voice solemn.

“Has Hargus awakened?”

“He remains in slumber, my lord. His transformation is expected to complete by dawn.”

His tone carried a mix of emotion and anticipation.

  Once he awakens, Dawnveil City will gain another formidable combat force.

“Under your leadership, the domain transforms daily—truly astonishing.”

Lier gave a slight nod, bypassing the topic.

  She gestured to the Green Grass Grandma beside her, gave a brief introduction, then continued.

  “Settle them in. Tomorrow, have Green Grass Grandma inspect the pitcher plants, the rainbow moss, and the fishtail grass.”

  “From now on, these plants within the domain can be entrusted to their care.”

The pitcher plants and multicolored moss were both 1-star plants, while the fishtail grass was merely an ordinary plant. If their quality could be enhanced, it would be a tremendous boon for the domain.

He harbored great expectations for these unique marsh-dwelling lifeforms.

  Bain finally understood upon hearing the introduction—these were the legendary Green Grass Grandmothers who tended the magical gardens for the Swamp God.

Excitement and delight spilled from his face.

  “Please follow me.”

The Green Grass Grandmothers featured in many swamp legends; nearly every hereditary swamp life had heard their names.

They immediately led the group down with great enthusiasm.

  Seeing this, Lier dismissed his troops to rest. He then took the Bubble Beast carrying the recovered corpse to Hargus, who was still undergoing transformation.

Five squads of Wetland Lizardmen warriors stood guard, vigilantly protecting the area to prevent any disturbances.

  The blood essence placed beside him that morning was now reduced to mere residue.

The energy fluctuations emanating from Hargus and the Swift Mad Lizard had gradually stabilized, no longer surging with such intensity.

  It seemed the corpses in hand were temporarily useless; their metamorphosis had entered its latter stages, where mere flesh and blood could no longer suffice.

Nevertheless, to be safe, over a hundred corpses were retained. The rest were given to the Bubble Beast to feed the Flesh Slaughterer.

  As the devoured flesh grew ever more abundant, the time for that divine life to awaken drew steadily nearer.

  The night grew deeper, the air settling into stillness. Gone was the clamor of daylight.

Heavy clouds blanketed the sky, the moon offering no light. Utter darkness enveloped the surroundings.

Lier did not rest, silently keeping vigil beside Hargus.


He could sense the other's essence beginning to stir, like a dragon's egg on the verge of hatching.

Time flew by, deep into the night, past midnight.

A sliver of moonlight pierced through the clouds, spilling across the marsh.

  Everything around was cloaked in a silver veil.

Ah!!!

A sudden, piercing scream jolted Dawnveil City awake.

Sleepers snapped their eyes open, instinctively sitting up and turning their heads to look around.

  What was that sound?

  Immediately, a second roar echoed.

  “Enemy attack!!!”

  Skin tightened instantly, sleepiness vanishing as everyone leapt to their feet, gazing toward the borders of their domain.

  The Wetland Lizardmen warriors reacted first, their faces contorting with savage intent as they charged directly toward the source of the sound.

Lier's heart skipped a beat in that instant. She sprang to her feet and strode forward.

The two-headed ogre chieftain, Ett, happened to be on the road.

  “Master!”

Lier's tone was stern.

“Organize the troops for defense immediately. No panic!”

She turned to face Bain, who had rushed over.

“Lead all residents into the Town Hall.”

  “Have the Vine Fairy merge with the town hall, sealing the space to prevent enemy entry.”

Having weathered a series of trials by blood and fire, Lier was no longer the same person. She issued her commands decisively and calmly.

  Seeing their leader so composed, the two heroes' inner turmoil instantly subsided. Bain immediately went to organize personnel and evacuate the residents.

The two-headed ogre chieftain abruptly turned to rally the surging swamp lizardmen warriors.

  In that brief moment, the roars and clashes ahead grew ever more frenzied.

Lier led the gathered swamp lizardmen warriors to the southern edge of the territory.

  Now visible in the grassy fringe were countless monsters swarming toward them.

These creatures measured about five feet in length, their backs adorned with four pairs of wings flapping frantically, churning air currents.

  However, due to their weight, they could only hover at a low altitude of just over a meter.

Their bodies resembled those of flies, with heads similarly fly-like, yet their mouths were filled with sharp, pointed teeth.

Four ghastly white human arms protruded from their torsos.

  Scorpion-like curved hooks bent downward toward the ground beneath their abdomens, their menacing stingers reflecting a sinister glow.

Their aura was wicked and grotesque, like dark monsters born from piles of corpses.

  A dense swarm of thumb-sized flies swarmed around it.

The sight was grotesque and terrifying, sending shivers down one's spine.

Their numbers were staggering—over a thousand could be seen at a glance.

And who knew how many more lurked hidden behind the grass?

  Several vigilant Wetland Lizardmen ahead were instantly swallowed by the swarm.

The onslaught was relentless.

Plague Fly

【Level】: 6
【Potential】: 2 Stars

  [Racial Talent]: Plague Spreader. Carries deadly pathogens; attacks infect foes with corruption.

[Skills]: Death Bite (1-star) – Sharp teeth tear through flesh and bone.

  Armor-Piercing Venom Sting (2 stars)
Its tail stinger is exceptionally sharp, easily piercing through enemy armor defenses.

  【Evaluation】: A unit bred by the Evil Demigod—Lord of Foulness and Flies—fierce and brutal.

  Lier's expression grew unusually grave.

  The Plague Fly is that demigod?!!

  The latest intelligence revealed the location of the enemy's followers, whom he had already added to the elimination list.

  But he never expected them to come knocking so quickly!

  “Form ranks! Deploy formations!”

Six entire squadrons of Wetland Lizardmen converged!

These fearless warriors formed an unshakable defensive line at the domain's edge.

  Amber eyes glared coldly at these monstrosities.

  ROAR!!

  A terrifying shriek erupted from the grass behind the Plague Flies.

  The swamp lizardmen warriors felt a vision flash through their minds—a dark demon crawling from the abyss, its body covered in rotting flesh, swarming with countless nauseating flies, its cold gaze fixed upon them.

  In the next instant, it seemed poised to tear through space and emerge.

They could even smell the nauseating stench of decay emanating from it.

For a moment,


The momentum abruptly waned, and the formation began to falter.

Lier sensed something amiss, her gaze turning icy.

A demigod dares to try and overpower my army?

The divine essence within her radiated a幽 blue glow, and boundless divine might surged forth, forcibly dispelling that oppressive aura.

  The army snapped back to alertness, their gazes growing colder and more savage.

Rage was building. Damned bastard!

Roar!

Realizing the demigod's pressure was useless, the Plague Flies behind him emitted another bloodcurdling shriek.

  Like a trumpet sounding the charge.

Dense swarms of Plague Flies buzzed~ Their wings flapped violently as their hideous bodies lunged forward.

  As far as the eye could see, a dark, oppressive mass surged forward like a towering tidal wave crashing against the reef.

If the front lines couldn't hold, the entire domain would be flattened in an instant.

Death was certain!

  “Kill!”

The two-headed ogre chieftain Ett charged forward, gripping his massive wolf-tooth club as he roared with fury.

The veins on his neck bulged like twisted ropes.

  As the Plague Flies closed in, his muscles coiled like springs wound to their limit, exploding outward.

Whoosh~ The massive flail swung through the air, making it crackle.

It slammed into the enemy ahead.

  Crack~Thud~

Bones snapped cleanly, flesh and blood exploding outward.

The three Plague Flies ahead shattered like watermelons struck by a baseball, green blood and slime splattering the ground.

Shattered clean through!

  Buzz~Buzz~Buzz~

  Both sides instantly clashed.

  A battle of flesh and blood.

  Wetland lizardmen warriors wielding steel blades charged the front lines. Their Level 7 status and fully-armored central armor gave them a clear advantage.

  A Wetland Lizardman Warrior swung his steel blade, hacking down fiercely. The Plague Fly ahead flapped its wings violently, dodging the strike.

But the Wetland Lizardman Warrior charged forward with a savage grin, colliding with its opponent.

  The opponent's form faltered, slowing its flight. In that instant, the claws struck.

Pfft~ Piercing flesh, sinking deep into the chest.

Then a forceful twist inside.

Green slime spurted wildly.

  The Plague Fly, pained, emitted a shrill screech like glass scraping against iron.

It bit viciously into the Wetland Lizardman's arm. Crunch~ Terrifying force left tiny teeth marks on the armor.

Piercing straight through.

  The swamp lizardman warrior roared, swinging his blade in a horizontal chop.

  Psssh~

  Severing its head clean off.

  Green slime splattered him, but without a second's hesitation, he lunged at the next one.

  Amidst the chaos, a Plague Fly suddenly tackled a Wetland Lizardman, its tail stinger plunging in with a sharp thud.

  The unarmored Wetland Lizardman's abdomen was instantly ripped open.

  Yet the injury only ignited its savage nature.

Enraged, it seized the pestilence fly's head with one claw while swinging the other with brutal force.

Its sharp talons pierced clean through the creature's skull.

  The monster thrashed a few times before stiffening abruptly.

Though it had killed its foe, blood gushed relentlessly from its own abdominal wound.

Feeling its condition rapidly deteriorate, the swamp lizard man's heart grew colder.

  Such an injury meant certain death on the battlefield.

But in an instant, he grew even more frenzied.

If he was going to die, he'd drag a few others down to hell with him!!

Roaring with rage, he charged forward.

  Yet as he locked combat with the next Plague Fly, a wave of warm energy suddenly surged into his body.

  The wound in his abdomen began healing at an absurdly rapid pace.

  Simultaneously, the Plague Fly's potent venom was forcibly suppressed.

  What was this?

  Amidst his confusion, he unleashed even greater power. Trading life for life, he slew the enemy before him once more, then whipped his head around.

Through the gaps in the crowd, a towering figure of extraordinary valor stood watching the battlefield, his gaze as deep and vast as the starry sky.

  His eyes brimmed with encouragement and admiration.

The Overlord?!

He knows healing magic?!

The newly joined Wetland Lizardman's heart trembled. In all his days of wandering and fighting across the wilderness, he'd never received such treatment.

  Feeling his strength rapidly returning, he spun around and charged forward with a roar.

This time, he was even more frenzied than before.

Because behind him, the void was no longer empty—he now had someone to rely on!

Though Lier hadn't joined the frontline battle...


But his role was irreplaceable.

Whenever the front lines suffered casualties, he would immediately cast Swamp Blessing.

After leveling up, his mana had skyrocketed to 1200 points, allowing him to cast the spell forty times in succession.

Moreover, after reaching level 7, his mana regeneration rate had also increased, restoring over 300 points per minute.

  Enough to cast Swamp Blessing ten times over.

  Thus, single-handedly, he managed to heal back to full health a large number of severely wounded, even mortally injured, Wetland Lizardmen.

  Forcibly propping up the entire front line.

  Meanwhile, the Bubble Beasts and Bog Wraiths gathered and rushed to the rear.

The Bubble Beasts struck first, blowing up bubbles one after another, violently compressing air to form bubble bombs.

They then drew long arcs through the air before plummeting downward.

  Boom~

They detonated violently at the enemy's center.

The shockwave was fierce, kicking up vast swathes of mud.

The Plague Flies possessed tenacious vitality; the bubbles alone couldn't kill them outright.

  But the explosion disrupted their formation and offensive rhythm.

This allowed the Wetland Lizardmen warriors to respond more calmly.

Meanwhile, the Swamp Siren beside them began to hum softly.

  The powerful allure momentarily disoriented the plague flies on the battlefield, but within a breath, they shook it off and resumed their frenzied slaughter.

  Shrouded in the will of a demigod, they possessed exceptional resistance to the swamp banshee's song.

A Level 7 swamp banshee was still unable to breach the demigod's barrier.

Seeing this, Lier immediately commanded.

  “Mar, focus your magic on the fiercest combat zones. At the critical moment, plunge them into illusion.”

The swamp banshee instantly altered her tactics. Whenever she detected intense pestilence fly assaults in certain areas, she began humming.

By narrowing the scope, the foes' sluggishness extended to two breaths.

  Though still brief, it was sufficient for the Wetland Lizardmen to turn the tide.

On the battlefield, a blink's pause could be deadly!

Meanwhile, the battle's accompanying fury, resentment, cruelty, and madness surged toward the Swamp Siren like a tidal wave.

  Though not as clear and digestible as in theatrical performances, their sheer volume still sated the swamp nymphs.

The aura radiating from their bodies surged rapidly.

As the battle reached its fever pitch, countless plague flies—their numbers impossible to estimate—continued pouring out densely from the grassy thickets behind.

  Too many. Far too many.

The human wave tactic was now being pushed to its absolute limit.

Buzz... buzz... buzz~

At that very moment, an even more terrifying flapping of wings echoed through the sky.

  The ferociously attacking disease flies looked up to see an endless black tide surging from the heavens.

Fist-sized swamp wasps with menacing stingers had finally arrived on the battlefield.

Over sixty thousand of them formed a terrifying swarm.

  Like arrows in midair, they plunged downward with frenzied ferocity.

  Zzzzzz~
  Psssh~

  At breakneck speed, their ten-centimeter-long stingers—sharp as steel needles—sank deep into the bodies of the Plague Flies.

  These monsters, also possessing venomous stingers that secreted deadly toxins and carried pathogens, lacked the wetland lizardmen's immunity to pain.

  The potent venom seared into their bodies, unleashing soul-shredding agony—as if someone were grinding their flesh and blood with a blender inside.

  The agony drove the Plague Fly into a frenzy, shrieking madly as it lashed its stinger and tore with its jaws.

It sought to strike back.

Though the Swamp Wasps were higher-tier, their thin blood and small frames meant they perished instantly upon being struck.

Casualties mounted rapidly.

  Yet their sheer numbers proved overwhelming; such losses barely dented the swarm's scale.

Faced with these high-speed, darting creatures and lacking effective countermeasures, the Plague Flies could only rage helplessly.

  Most deadly of all, the Wetland Lizardmen warriors before them would not let them deal with the Swamp Wasps.

  They unleashed even fiercer attacks.

  Driving the Plague Flies into retreat, step by step.

  Under the combined assault of the Swamp Wasps, Wetland Lizardmen, Bubble Beasts, and Marsh Sirens,

these dark forces—suddenly unleashed by the demigod—were swiftly eradicated.

  The battlefield resembled a high-speed meat grinder, pulverizing every last enemy.

These insects were truly cruel and frenzied—even when utterly overwhelmed, they still charged forward.

Eyes


Not a trace of fear lingered within him.

The plague flies rapidly dwindled to fewer than a hundred.

Just as Lier prepared to utterly annihilate his foes, a third piercing shriek echoed from behind.

  “Insects! How dare you defy the immortal will of my god? You all deserve death!”

A muffled, frenzied voice seeped into her mind. Though she couldn't understand the language, its meaning was crystal clear.

Psssh~

  Four or five Wetland Lizardmen near the grass ahead were suddenly slammed by a colossal force.

Like stones struck by a wooden club, their bodies exploded forward twenty or thirty meters before crashing heavily to the ground.

Thud~ Splashes of mud and flesh flew everywhere.

  Focusing intently, he saw blood pouring from their seven orifices as their breath abruptly ceased.

Lier whipped his head around.

A terrifying monster over three and a half meters tall appeared before him, its fly-like wings flapping frantically, lifting it twenty centimeters off the ground.

  It walked upright yet twisted grotesquely, its body covered in vast patches of rotting flesh crawling with flies.

  Four ghastly white arms gripped a massive double-bladed battleaxe, its form ablaze with pale green energy.

  Its head was that of a fly, its blood-red compound eyes gleaming with madness and savagery.

Plague Fly General

Level: 12, Potential: 3 stars, Race Talent: . Health: 3500

  Heroic Talent—Rotting Flesh Surge: After taking damage, rapidly devours decaying flesh to recover.

  Skills: Crushing Execution (3 stars) Unleashes full power to instantly execute foes, dealing triple damage to targets smaller than itself.

  Will of My God (3 stars) Summons the will of a demigod, greatly enhancing combat prowess.

  Star Shatter (3 stars) Slashes a 20-meter-long blade of vitality, shattering all enemies.

  Evaluation: A formidable hero cultivated by the Lord of Foulness and Flies.

  This is a Level 12 hero at peak condition, unrestrained and possessing a full three 3-star skills.

  But that's not all—a black magic ring radiating immense energy glows atop his head.

  Ring of the Dead

  Level: 2-star

  Properties:
1. A unique ring sealing ten thousand souls. Upon attack, it unleashes a piercing shriek that penetrates the enemy's soul.
2. Power of Obliteration: Attacks carry the force of annihilation, causing the enemy's flesh to rot away instantly.

  Not only is its innate power ferocious, but it also wields magical equipment!

  Lier's gaze grew intensely grave.

  This enemy is far too powerful.

  The two heads of the Two-Headed Ogre Chief Ett now fixed their gaze fiercely upon the ferocious Plague Fly General.

  His eyes blazed with savage combat intent. His transformation had reached a critical juncture.

If he could slay this ferocious foe, he would surely take that decisive step forward.

For Dawnveil City, for his master, for vengeance!

Kill!!




Chapter 86: After the Battle, the Demigod's Eyeball (5800 words)

  The two-headed ogre chieftain stood three meters tall, a figure like a miniature giant. Yet even he was dwarfed by the Plague Fly General.

  But he charged forward without fear.

  The Plague Fly General flapped its wings, its crimson fly eyes suddenly blazing with a chilling intent to kill.

  It charged forward, dual-bladed battle-axes in hand.

  The two closed the distance in an instant.

  The two-headed ogre chieftain leapt upward, swinging his massive wolf-tooth club down from above.

Whoosh~

The air shattered with a roaring blast.

  The Plague Fly General swung his double-bladed battle-axe horizontally.

Clang~

Sparks flew as the clash produced a metallic ringing sound.

  The collision of their vital energies erupted in vast plumes of pale green and crimson flame-like energy, scattering across the sky.

Like sparks bursting from forged iron.

In that instant, the two-headed ogre chieftain felt countless mad, shrieking voices echo within his mind.

  Like the agonized curses and screams of ten thousand souls enduring brutal torture.

Simultaneously, the recoil force nearly wrenched his wolf-tooth club from his grasp.

Though attacking from above granted him the advantage, his strike was effortlessly parried.

  His expression darkened.

But in an instant, he suppressed all agitation. With a roar, he launched an even fiercer assault.

The Plague Fly General ahead met him with a cold glare, swinging his weapon to clash head-on.

  The two-headed ogre chieftain's strength was formidable, but the Plague Fly General was stronger.

Moreover, each of the opponent's attacks was accompanied by a soul-piercing shrill shockwave.

It made his expression grow dazed, his face increasingly grim.

  An unevolved Level 11 hero faced a fully-armed top-tier hero.

  The gap between them now stretched vast.

  The annihilating power of the 2-star magical equipment—the Ring of the Dead—proved unbearable for the Two-Headed Ogre Chieftain.

  Once wounded, the flesh rapidly rotted away, rendering even the most potent healing abilities useless.

As the wounds multiplied, flies swarming the decaying flesh caught the scent, flapping their wings toward the source.

  Landing on the wounds, they began to gnaw.

  Pathogens corroded the body like venom.

  Amidst the fierce battle, the two-headed ogre chieftain's vitality rapidly declined.

  Within a mere seven or eight minutes, he felt his strength failing, each clash growing heavier.

  The weapon in his hands felt as heavy as a mountain, nearly impossible to lift.

Unnoticed, blood seeped from his nose, eyes, ears, and mouth.

Those tiny flies possessed healing-suppressing properties!

Lier's healing effects from behind had plummeted to zero, unable to restore him.

  He was dying.

  The thought struck him like a bolt of lightning.

  The two-headed ogre chieftain's bloodshot eyes burned with refusal.

  How could he die here? How could he?!

  He hadn't witnessed Dawnveil City's rise! He hadn't returned to the Shattered Star Plane to slay the traitor who murdered his father and reclaim his throne!

How could he fall here?!

Aaah!!

  A hysterical roar erupted from his throat.

  The smaller, closed secondary head on his shoulder opened its eyes at that instant.

  A dark, vicious gaze locked onto the Plaguefly General.

  The two-headed ogre chieftain felt as though fresh energy surged through his body.

  His aura surged with ferocious speed, roaring~ as his vital energy ignited.

  Like an erupting volcano, it unleashed towering waves of flame.

  “Kill!”

With a roar, he charged forward.

At that moment, a serious expression flickered in the General Plague Fly's blood-red compound eyes.

“Reptile, you have earned the right to have your head collected by me.”

  A cold voice pierced his mind.

The opponent's aura abruptly shifted.

Muscles bulged violently as four pallid arms gripped twin-bladed battle-axes, raising them overhead. With a shrill screech, they swung down in a brutal diagonal strike.

  The air itself rippled!

Heavy Strike Execution (3-Star) unleashed its full power to instantly execute the enemy, dealing triple damage to foes smaller than itself.

The two-headed ogre chieftain likewise raised his flail behind him, roaring as he swung it.

  In that instant, he unleashed power beyond anything witnessed before.

  Both sides clashed...


The weapons clashed instantly.

  Crack~

  Thud~

  The wolf-tooth club was cleaved clean in two!

  Under the two-headed ogre chieftain's stunned gaze, the long-handled double-bladed battleaxe, its momentum unabated, slammed into his body.

  Splash~

A horrific gash tore from his chest down to his abdomen.

Ribs shattered, entrails spilling forth.

  Only now could outsiders clearly see the gap between heroes.

  The Plague Fly General, lavishly equipped and at the peak of his power, crushed the two-headed ogre chieftain who had yet to complete his transformation.

  In his final peripheral vision, he saw only the Plague Fly General's wings flapping as it approached slowly, its form towering like a mountain.

  Pfft~ A mouthful of blood spurted forth, and his fingers clenched suddenly.

  In utter unwillingness, he collapsed unconscious.

  Seeing this, the Plague Fly General flapped his wings forward, intending to execute the two-headed ogre chieftain outright.

  But at that very moment.

  Boom~

  Several bubbles plummeted down, exploding beside him.

  A violent shockwave rippled through the air.

Dust swirled, obscuring his vision.

When he regained his senses, the two-headed ogre had vanished, carried away by the bubbles.

  Focusing his gaze, he saw that the remaining Plague Flies had been slaughtered during his earlier battle.

The battlefield was littered with corpses and flesh, the green slime mingling with crimson blood stains was particularly jarring.

  The foul stench of blood and the strange odor of slime assaulted his nostrils, making him want to vomit.

The bubble had failed to inflict even a scratch on the Plague Fly General.

The gap between an 8th-level Bubble Beast and a 12th-level Hero was simply too vast.

  The swamp banshee's relentless wailing from the rear failed to distract the enemy even for an instant.

The high-attack assassins like the Mud Swamp Wasps, who had charged during the earlier clash, were instantly consumed when they touched the faint green energy blazing from the enemy. Their souls ignited, their life force extinguished.

  Like moths drawn to flames.

With one tactic after another failing, Lier now viscerally understood the brutality of elite combat power.

Previously, hunting the Mosquito Queen of equal rank had been supported by intelligence and the creation of a countering 3-star alchemical potion.

  Now, abruptly confronting such a monstrous foe, overwhelming pressure crashed down upon him.

A single enemy could render an entire army helpless. To kill it, only sheer numbers would suffice.

Lier's gaze turned icy.

  “All troops, heed my command.”

He had trained his army for this very moment—a day long anticipated!

“Charge!!”

His deep voice carried unwavering resolve.

Without hesitation, the army surged forward.

  Their eyes locked onto the Plague Fly General.

Death? What was that? A warrior's glory lay in falling on the charge!

But in that instant—BOOM!—a colossal, towering presence erupted from behind.

  Like a dragon breaking free from its shell.

The Plague Fly General snapped his head toward the source, his eyes flashing with apprehension and gravity for the first time.

Danger. Deadly danger!

  As if a blade had been pressed against his throat—deadly and savage.

  Roar~

  A deep, suppressed roar echoed across the heavens and earth.

  Thud thud~

  Thud thud~

  The earth trembled. Liermen turned to see a figure mounted upon a ferocious beast.

Hargus. Awoken!

This heroic lizardman, now towering at 2.8 meters, had outgrown his armor long ago and cast it aside.

  His entire body was covered in palm-sized scales that gleamed with a metallic sheen. His muscles bulged prominently, radiating an indescribable sense of power—as if a single punch could shatter city walls!

  His gaze was fierce, his aura overwhelming.

  Beneath him stood a three-meter-tall Swift Frenzy Lizard.

Its forelimbs were short, yet its claws were sharper than blades. Its hind legs were thick and powerful, capable of crushing boulders effortlessly while running.

  Its scales were fine yet equally metallic, offering armor-like defense.

Its tail whipped like a steel whip, cutting through the air with a shrill hiss. A single lash could shatter a human body.

  Its jaws stand slightly open, revealing saw-like teeth capable of tearing through steel.

Most crucially, the aura emanating from both is perfectly aligned, indistinguishable from one another.

Coldblooded Cavalry.


argus, job change successful!

Lier glanced at the interface panel. The opponent's gleaming Level 12 caused his breath to catch.

After his advancement, his level had skyrocketed to 12!!

He was now on par with that demi-god-bred evil hero!

  His gaze fixed on the Plague Fly General, his voice deepened.

  “Hargus, execute him!”

  They could wear down the Plague Fly General with human sacrifices, but for Dawnveil City, it would be an unbearable, catastrophic loss.

  Soldier against soldier, commander against commander!

Hargus's amber eyes turned icy cold.

While he lay dormant in metamorphosis, this bastard dared attack his domain and slaughter his comrades.

Unforgivable. All deserve death!!

  The newly transformed Wetland Lizardman hero charged forward.

  The Swift Frenzied Lizard stomped the ground, sending thunderous vibrations rippling out.

  His speed was like lightning, leaving a trail of afterimages.

  A steel blade gripped tightly in one hand, the other steadying the Swiftfury Lizard, his gaze brimming with savagery and cruelty.

The crowd instinctively parted, letting Hargus pass through.

The Plaguefly General gripped his long-handled double-bladed war axe, endless pale green energy surging into it.

  He swung it out with brutal force.

A terrifying crescent blade of energy sliced fiercely through the void.

Destroy everything!

Caught off guard, Hargus jerked sideways. Pfft~ But a chunk of flesh and bone was torn clean off his shoulder.

  Blood spattered.

Half a shoulder gone, the sight was utterly gruesome.

The army behind him held its breath.

But the next moment, to everyone's astonishment, the wounded enemy began healing at a visible, rapid pace. In mere blinks, he was restored.

  Heroic Talent—Regeneration!

In that brief instant, Hargus had already charged before the Plague Fly General.

His steel blade swung down.

  Clang!

It collided directly with the long-handled double-bladed battleaxe.
Sparks flew everywhere.
The two instantly locked in combat.
The terrifying gush of blood and flesh was ten times fiercer than the previous battle.

  But this time, the Plague Fly General no longer held overwhelming dominance.

Instead, Hargus pressed the advantage, driving the enemy back again and again.

No matter how fiercely the Plague Fly General erupted, Hargus forcibly pinned him down!

  The Swift Fierce Lizard beneath him moved with agile precision while wielding formidable combat prowess.

Its jaws tore, its tail lashed like a steel whip, and its razor-sharp forelimbs inflicted devastating wounds upon the Plague Fly General.

Not a single inch could be overlooked.

  Coupled with its near-monstrous regenerative ability—healing grievous wounds within mere breaths—it unleashed terrifying combat prowess.

  Spectating Wetland Lizardmen watched in awe, their minds reeling.

  Lier watched the battle unfold, eyes fixed on the arena.

  Was this the combat power achieved after advancing to 3-star potential and dual-enhancing through the Coldblooded Cavalry class change?

  Fierce!

  Incredibly fierce!

  The Plague Fly General sensed Hargus's terrifying might and began to lose his mind.

  Yet even the most ferocious assaults were forcibly suppressed!

  The steel blade in his hand, enveloped in vital energy, became incredibly resilient and razor-sharp.

  He stood his ground against the enemy's three-meter-long double-bladed axe, forcing the foe to retreat repeatedly.

Recalling how the ferocious two-headed ogre chieftain had been easily subdued by the Plague Fly General, the gap in strength became starkly apparent.

  Just how far had this Wetlands Lizardman hero advanced?

Splatter~

The Plaguefly General was cleaved by Hargus's blade, flesh exploding once more.

His body was now covered in dense, crisscrossing scars.

  Hargus, however, remained unscathed!

The Plague Fly General staggered back several paces, snatching up the flesh of fallen flies from the ground. It instantly dissolved, and his wounds began healing rapidly.

Noticing this, Hargus sneered coldly and charged forward, denying him a second chance to recover.

  Though the General's hero talent was potent, it required time. Hargus's talent directly consumed his internal energy to heal wounds.

The two abilities were fundamentally different.

Soon, the Plague Fly General was driven to the brink.

Covered in wounds, unable to pause for recovery, and surrounded by D...


The armies of Awnveil City closed in, encircling him completely.

Once he weakened, they would swarm him and finish him off.

He sensed the scent of death.

With a roar,

an indescribable, terrifying power surged from his body.

  In that instant, the sky itself seemed to darken.

Lier's gaze sharpened.

The Lord of Bloodlust and Flies!

The demigod fixed his eyes upon the battlefield.

  “My Lord, grant me your power!”

After the Plague Fly General roared, that supreme will shattered abruptly, then surged entirely into his body.

The aura emanating from him surged at a visible pace.

  Exploding with fury, he charged savagely toward Hargus.

  But in that instant, Hargus clenched his battle blade, channeling his power into it with reckless abandon.

  Even the Swift Mad Lizard, which had been sitting with its head lowered, now unleashed all its power.

  “Aaah!!!”

  A frenzied roar erupted from his throat.

  The Swift Mad Lizard charged forward, swinging its battle blade directly at the Plague Fly General.

  The enemy raised his long-handled battleaxe to meet the blow head-on, but in the next instant—

Clang! The axe handle snapped clean off. The steel blade sliced down from the chest with unstoppable momentum.

Infinite power erupted.

  Slashing diagonally downward from his chest, it severed half his torso!

  The momentum that had surged to its peak was now brutally trampled into the mud!

  Terrifying agony froze the Plague Fly General's body for an instant. Hargus's steel blade slid cleanly free.

  As they passed each other, he spun violently, swinging his blade down from behind.

A backhand slash!

Splatter~ Half a head was severed clean off.

Brain matter mixed with green slime sprayed wildly.

  Thud~ The massive corpse collapsed to the ground with an expression of utter disbelief, crashing heavily into the earth, lifeless forever.

  Plague Fly General, dead!

  The will that had lingered around him suddenly coalesced once more.

  In the void, a distorted, blurry figure covered in flies materialized. The shadowy form fixed a deep, lingering gaze upon Lier before vanishing into nothingness.

A sudden, profound silence descended upon the battlefield.

  Lier turned to survey the scene, the ground littered with corpses and shattered remains.

Hargus stood tall amidst the carnage, his presence strikingly prominent.

Thus, the sudden, bloody assault came to an end.

  【You commanded your forces to repel and annihilate the attack by the followers of the Demigod—Lord of Stench and Flies—thus safeguarding your domain. You gain an additional piece of intelligence: Lord of Stench and Flies bestowed the eye he retained after his metamorphosis upon the Plague Fly General before you. Extracting his right eye will grant access to the essence within it, unlock passage to the plane where the Lord of Stench and Flies resides."

  The sudden intelligence flashed through Lier's mind, lifting his spirits.

  His gaze fell upon the corpse of the Plague Fly General.

  “Clear the battlefield. Bury the remains of our fallen warriors.”

  “Gather the other corpses together.”

  As the surrounding troops bustled to obey his orders, he strode over to the Plague Fly General's body.

  “Gouge out its right eye.”

A Wetland Lizardman warrior nearby immediately complied, extracting the right eye.

Holding it in his hand, it felt smooth and cold, resembling a crimson gemstone.

Focusing his gaze, its attributes appeared in his mind.

  Evil Eyeball

  Grade: 3-Star

  Properties: Implanting this within a body will cause extreme corruption, yet simultaneously grant a significant increase in power.

  Evaluation: An eye left behind by a demigod's metamorphosis.

This was actually a 3-star treasure.

Its properties were quite unique.

Carefully sensing with his spirit, he discovered a distinct power hidden within.

  By channeling energy into it, one could unlock a portal to the plane inhabited by the Lord of Filth and Flies.

After calming his nerves, his gaze shifted to the Death Ring adorning the Plague Fly General's head.

This 2-star magical artifact was now his spoils of war.

  He signaled the warriors beside him to retrieve it.

The moment Lier took it, a chill crept over him—the cold breath of death, the wailing of countless souls trapped within.

He weighed it briefly before passing it to Hargus.

“This artifact...”


“Bestowed upon you.”

  The Dead Man's Ring suited melee heroes. As a healer, he needn't charge the front lines to battle foes.

  Hargus dismounted his Swift-Rushing Lizard, kneeling on one knee upon the battlefield as he respectfully accepted it.

  “Thank you for your gift, Sovereign.”

  His voice carried excitement and exhilaration.

  It wasn't just the gift of this weapon, but the twice-bestowed power of a hero.

  In the wilderness, strength matters more than life!

  This debt of gratitude could never be repaid, even with his life.

Lier nodded without further comment.

The search continued.

However, no other treasures were found on the fallen foe.

Finally, the severed weapon of the Plague Fly General was also retrieved.

  A three-meter-long double-bladed battleaxe with a long handle. Perhaps due to its crude craftsmanship, it was merely an ordinary piece of equipment.

  Its surface was pitted and uneven, resembling the shoddy work of a small workshop.

  The metal itself was clearly of excellent quality, but the workmanship was lacking.

  Once the blacksmith's forge is built, perhaps it can be remelted.

The crowd sheltering in the town hall, upon learning the battle had ended and the domain remained unharmed, all departed the hall.

As far as the eye could see, they were all physical beings.

  The gruesome scenes made their hearts tremble; they couldn't fathom how fierce the battle had been.

Had the army been breached, an unprecedented catastrophe would have awaited them.

Fortunately, the Lord led his forces to repel the enemy and emerged victorious!

  Victory in external warfare, eliminating enemy threats, forever proved the finest means to unite hearts and minds.

  After the initial fear subsided, the residents' sense of belonging to the domain quietly deepened.

  They began stepping forward to assist.

  Half an hour later, the losses and gains from the battle were tallied.

  First, the losses—the Wetland Lizardmen warriors on the front lines suffered the heaviest casualties.

  Despite home-field advantage, backed by support from the Bubble Beasts, Swamp Wasps, and Bog Sirens, and with Lier providing frantic healing, they still lost six squads.

  Total troop strength dropped to 550.

Additionally, roughly 5,000 Swamp Wasps perished in the melee.

Their overall numbers fell to just over 50,000.

Notably, three Barbarians stationed at the stronghold also fell in battle.

  Additionally, the two-headed ogre chieftain was struck in the abdomen by the Plague Fly General, severely wounded and now slumbering.

  As for spoils, over 2,400 Level 6 Plague Fly corpses were gathered.

  Piled together, they formed a dense, small hill.

Given the enemy's numbers, losing only six squads was commendable.

The two-star magical artifacts carried by the Plaguefly General—the Ring of the Dead and the severed double-bladed battleaxe in his hand—were also secured.

  Lastly, the three-star Evil Eye was secured.

Lier listened to the report, remaining silent for a long while as she stared intently at the Plague Fly General's eyes.

A demigod, huh?

  Good. Very good.

A cold gleam flashed in her eyes.

This blood debt can only be repaid with blood!

She took the eyeball and turned her gaze to Bain beside her.

“Have the fallen warriors' bodies been collected?”

  “All have been recovered.”

“Bury these heroes tomorrow morning.”

“Henceforth, increase night patrols to two companies and expand coverage to five kilometers.”

  “Yes, my lord!”

After a flurry of activity, the domain fell silent once more.

Yet tonight, most found sleep elusive.

After dismissing the troops to rest, Lier turned to Hargus, who stood beside the Swift Ferocious Lizard.

  She opened his attribute panel once more.

The Plague Fly General, whose attributes had surged after being touched by the demigod's will, had been slain at the peak of his power!

Just how powerful was this man?

With a hint of anticipation, she studied the details intently.

  Hargus

  Hero Unit

  Rank: High Knight (Level 12)

  Potential: 3 Stars (Additional 30% Strength Boost)

  HP: 12,000

 


Chapter 87: Divine Life Awakens, Powerful Spirit Awakening Technique (4700 words)

  After reviewing Hargus's attributes, Lier's heart skipped a beat, her gaze burning with intense focus.

  Three 3-star skills, five special class skills, and a staggering 12,000 HP!!

  Second Talent—Body Mastery.

Absolute control over one's physique, capable of mobilizing every muscle fiber for precise manipulation.

Combined with the Regeneration Talent and a full complement of skills...

His combat prowess was off the charts.

  GOOGLE SEARCH TWKAN

  By comparison, the Plague Fly General—also level 12—possessed a mere 3,500 HP.

  Though formidable, it was insignificant compared to Hargus!

  No wonder even a demigod's will favored him—and still saw its head severed!

Fierce. Incredibly fierce!!

This is the apex combat power achieved after class-changing to Coldblooded Cavalry, unlocking latent potential, activating a second talent, and undergoing multiple enhancements!

  This transformation pushed Hargus to the peak of his 3-star potential, cementing him as Dawnveil City's undisputed strongest combatant.

  A new trump card in his hand!

  Satisfying.

  But as he came to his senses, a bittersweet worry crept in.

  Coldblooded Cavalry are powerful, but their cultivation demands immense resources.

Hargus's transformation was built upon devouring hundreds of corpses.

After pondering, he asked Hargus.

  “Does cultivating an ordinary Coldblooded Cavalry require as much as you did?”

  The Level 12 hero shook his head.

  “Master, an ordinary Coldblooded Cavalry only needs about a hundred corpses to cultivate the power I wield. Since I'm stronger than others, I naturally require more.”

  As a hero unit, his transformation naturally surpassed that of ordinary swamp lizardfolk.

Lier's inner turmoil eased slightly.

This was manageable; otherwise, she'd have her hands full.

Yet compared to the Coldblooded Cavalry's combat prowess, this cost seemed insignificant.

  As they spoke, Bain, the Swamp-Folk hero, hurried closer.

  “Master, all corpses have been transported to the Swamp Treant. Shall I have the Flesh-Slaughterer devour them immediately?”

  Lier replied in a low voice.

  “I'll be there shortly.”

Having witnessed the Plaguefly General's combat prowess, he gained new insight into the value of elite fighting power.

The divine lifeforms must awaken swiftly. In two months, they would face an even more ferocious and formidable foe—the Wyvern.

  Those were terrifying Level 15 beings, ten or even a hundred times stronger than the Plaguefly General!

  He had once considered surrounding them with his army, but after this battle, that notion had vanished.

  A flying dragon was utterly incapable of engaging in trench warfare.

  Even if all the Wetland Lizardmen were transformed into cold-blooded cavalry, it would be a struggle.

At the Swamp Treants' location, over two thousand corpses piled up like small hills.

The flesh energy contained within these Level 6 unit corpses was exceptionally abundant.

  This haul surpassed the combined yield of days of previous hunts.

The headless Flesh Slaughterer lay motionless on the ground, resembling an abyssal beast that had never awakened.

Approaching it, one immediately felt its soul-piercing aura.

  Lier waved, signaling the swamp treants to carry corpses and place them beside the Flesh Slaughterer.

The moment the bodies touched the ground, a faint crimson energy emanated from the creature, enveloping them.

The flesh rapidly dried, cracked, and crumbled into debris scattered across the floor.

  Corpses tossed into its midst vanished in an instant, devoured clean.

  Like stoking a furnace with fresh fuel.

  The Blood Slaughterer's aura surged with each infusion of nourishment, its crimson energy deepening.

  Soon, the over two thousand corpses were devoured entirely.

The Flesh Slaughterer's aura surged to a critical point.

Lier could clearly sense it was but a step away from awakening.

Her heart stirred with excitement.

  She turned to the final corpse—the Plague Fly General.

With a wave, she signaled the Wetland Lizardmen beside her to hoist the body and toss it into the crimson energy's domain.

Then, as if struck by an idea, she thought to herself—


He moved, retrieving the newly acquired three-star artifact—the Evil God's Eyeball.

With a tentative mindset, he stepped forward.

But as soon as he drew near, a powerful suction pulled the eyeball away.

  He witnessed the malevolent orb, like a red-hot steel ball plunging into ice and snow, instantly merging into the Blood Flesh Slaughterer's body.

  In that instant, a sharp crack—like shattering glass—echoed through the air.

  The creature's aura surged violently, an indescribable malevolence now shrouding the sky.

The silver moonlight instantly dimmed.

As if from the depths of an abyss, a being of utter depravity had crawled forth.

  Lying on the ground, a headless, horrifically stitched-together monstrosity twitched violently.

It slowly rose to its feet!!

In that instant, everyone present felt a chill run down their spines, their hair standing on end.

  Eyes wide, they stared fixedly at the Flesh Slaughterer.

Under the crowd's gaze, the evil entity slowly turned, facing Lier.

Lier could clearly sense the Flesh Slaughterer's stare upon him.

Even without a head!!

  That void-like, unseen gaze hung like a crimson sun in the sky—burning hot and utterly mad.

“My Lord!”

A hoarse, thunderous voice, tinged with ethereal quality, echoed from all directions.

  Then, this terrifying creature—bound together by the Merfolk God's divine power, having devoured a strand of divinity—knelt on one knee in the most humble posture.

  Bowing before him.

  No head... yet it can speak?

  The surrounding swamp lizardmen were drenched in cold sweat. Today truly broadened their horizons.

Lier stared directly at this terrifying creature.

Its neck resembled the bare stem left after plucking a melon, covered in large patches of dried blood.

  It delivered a bone-chilling visual impact.

Such a creature—regardless of combat prowess—would instill profound terror in any ordinary witness.

“Do you have a name?”

“Radina. The true name I received at birth.”

  Lier nodded.

Taking a deep breath, he opened its attribute panel.

Yet he fell silent again—it still displayed “Transformation in Progress” with no specific attributes listed.

“You haven't completed your transformation?”

  “My Lord, the eyeball you bestowed contains another unique power. I require approximately one day to consume it.”

The Blood Slaughterer's speech flowed smoothly and normally, as if conversing with a regular human.

Noticing this, Lier asked directly.

  “Have you gained knowledge inheritance?”

“Master. I possess vast memories of the merfolk.”

Only then did Lier understand.

The creature was formed from merfolk flesh and blood. Combined with its divine essence, it defied conventional reasoning.

  “But do you still need flesh?”

  Ladin shook his bald neck.

  “Digesting this eyeball is more crucial to me.”

  His voice carried a hint of excitement.

  “The lingering aura of the demigod within this eyeball is exceptionally unique. I might be able to use it to devour its power.”

Lier's eyes lit up.
Was that even possible?
After all, a demigod was a demigod. The other had been born from divinity itself—perhaps it wasn't so incomprehensible.

  Without further words, he waved for the creature to digest properly.

He cautioned it not to overreach—absorb the power of the Lord of Filth and Flies if possible, but don’t force it if not.

  Pushing it too far might make it lash out desperately, which would be counterproductive.

The Flesh Slaughterer immediately agreed, then lay back down beneath the swamp treant and fell into slumber once more.

But this time, its awakening was already within reach.

  Lier felt quite pleased.

Hargus had completed his transformation, and the divine life had awakened. Today brought more than its share of good fortune.

All things considered, the Lord of Filth and Flies had essentially delivered a wave of kills to him.

  Had they awakened sooner, the ferocious Plague Fly General would have been butchered without resistance.

The Flesh Slaughterer's aura was even more formidable and savage than Hargus'.

  After all, this was a divine being—its very origin lay beyond the reach of ordinary life.

With the spoils consumed, this sudden assault drew to a close.

The losses were significant, but the gains were equally substantial.




  Not a bad little profit.

  Lier didn't linger long, returning to her tent to rest.

  The next day, at dawn, the sun peeked through the clouds, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the horizon.

  The crowd had gathered early in front of the town hall.

  On the open ground, dozens of coffins woven from vines lay silently upon the earth.

The crowd was utterly silent.

A hero's funeral. This was the second time.

  Compared to the previous occasion, the residents felt a deeper sense of loss this time.

They had witnessed the gruesome scenes of bodies strewn across the land and the fallen Wetland Lizardmen warriors.

Many of the corpses had even been gathered by their own hands.

The fallen heroes had died fighting for them.

  Having witnessed it firsthand, they grasped the weight of those words more profoundly.

These fallen heroes had stood on the front lines against the enemy's onslaught.

Without these warriors, last night would have been a massacre.

The ones lying dead now would have been them!

  Lier silently approached the crowd, scanning the assembly with a calm yet solemn tone.

“Citizens of Dawnveil City, you are all aware that last night, the enemy attacked our domain.”

  “Those filthy, disgusting monsters sought to destroy our lands, seize our food, and devour our flesh!”

  Her voice grew increasingly urgent.

“But our warriors united and annihilated them!”

“They defended our lands and secured ultimate victory!”

“Yet we paid a terrible price.”

  “Do you see the coffins before you? Each one holds a hero who sacrificed last night to defend our domain, to protect every one of us!”

“Remember these heroes—they died fighting for us!”

“They shall never be forgotten, nor ever ignored.”

  “The Tomb of the Spirits shall be their final resting place, and Valhalla will echo with their names and legends.”

“They are the exemplars for us all!”

“There is no quiet or peace—danger lurks everywhere. It is our warriors who bear this burden for us!”

  “All glory belongs to them—dying great, dying glorious!”

“Raise the spirits!”

As these fiercely stirring words fell, everyone felt a flame ignite within their chests.

The domain's cohesion surged.

  The Wetland Lizardmen warriors immediately hoisted their comrade's coffin and set off for the Hall of the Fallen.

Lier walked alongside the coffin, while the Bog Wraiths scattered white flowers ahead, humming a sorrowful yet hopeful dirge.

  The atmosphere was solemn and dignified.

Those who had never experienced it before finally understood why people always said sacrificing for the domain was an honor.

The Lord himself carried the coffin.

All residents paid their respects. What an honor!

  At the burial, Lier once again placed the first shovel of earth with his own hands.

  Then a collective three-minute moment of silence was observed.

  When all was done and the crowd dispersed, the emotions lingered long within them.

  The barbarians were especially stirred.

  Last time, they were mere spectators. But this time was different—they too had fought in last night's bloody battle.

And two of their comrades had fallen on the front lines against the enemy!

Today, what left them deeply unsettled was that these two fallen barbarians had received the same honors and treatment!

  Even though this wasn't their homeland, even though they weren't even residents of this domain.

  Yet, in the face of such glory, the fire in their chests burned fiercely.

  To sacrifice for this domain wasn't something unacceptable—it was the greatest honor!

  Their very gait grew straighter and more resolute.

As the crowd dispersed, the barbarian leader Azaken suddenly spotted the Wetland Lizardman chieftain who had arrived in the domain two days prior, expressing suspicion toward Dawnveil City.

  He strode forward, blocking the man's path, his voice deep and measured.

  “Do you understand now?”

  The abrupt question left the Wetland Lizardman Chieftain speechless.

  After a long pause, he clasped his chest and bowed deeply.

  “I apologize.”

“I underestimated our domain, and more so, the Lord's magnanimity.”

Last night, he had fought near the barbarians and witnessed firsthand how two of them had fallen in battle.

Brave warriors.


Deserving of all respect.

Today, the honors bestowed upon fallen warriors far surpassed his imagination. He had always believed that finding a burial plot was already a tremendous blessing for a warrior who died in battle.

He never imagined they would receive such a solemn funeral, and that the names of all would be engraved in Valhalla!

  The Hall of Heroes!

  The gods built the Hall of Heroes to honor and encourage their faithful followers. Devout believers who died would enter it and be reborn.

  Human empires emulated the gods by establishing Halls of Heroes to celebrate and immortalize those who achieved great feats.

  Known to all.

Entering the Hall of Heroes is the highest praise and honor a warrior can receive.

No one could refuse.

Azaken's expression softened.

His tone grew complex.

  “It is an immense honor for us... for you to serve under the Lord.”

He patted the other's shoulder and turned to leave.

He was not a member of Dawnveil City; he had his own domain.

  Yet after spending over half a month here, he had developed a profound sense of belonging to this domain.

  Were it not for the responsibility of strengthening the Barbarians and building their first domain... perhaps he would have pledged his loyalty to this land's master long ago.

  Some men were born leaders, commanding willing allegiance.

The hero's funeral concluded, and the crowd dispersed to resume their tasks.

Death was a common occurrence in the wilderness, scarcely disrupting daily life.

Soon, Lier received more good news: progress had been made with Granny Greengrass.

  He immediately headed over to the area where the mutant pitcher plants were being cultivated, his spirits soaring.

At that moment, nine frail, reed-haired figures were busy working in the soil.

What surprised him was that the pitcher plants planted just two days prior had already grown to thigh height.

  And, remarkably, they were nodding their heads?

The sight of dozens of thigh-high pitcher plants swaying their heads in unison was quite amusing.

Spotting him approach, Green Grass Granny immediately bowed.

“Father God.”

  “What are you doing here?”

  The eldest Green Grass Grandma spoke softly.

  “Father God, these pitcher plants are perfect for bestowing sentience. We've already awakened their spirits.”

  Spirit Awakening—the Green Grass Grandma's innate talent—granted plants sentience and enabled communication with them.

  Lier's interest was piqued.

  She opened the pitcher plant's attributes for a glance.

  She discovered its level had risen from 1-star to 2-star, and it had gained a new trait—

  【Imbued with unique sentience and possessing some intelligence, it can actively absorb nutrients to accelerate its growth and hasten nectar secretion.】

  In just a moment, it became a 2-star magical plant?!

Lier found this quite unbelievable.

What's more interesting is that after gaining sentience, it can actively absorb nutrients to grow and accelerate nectar secretion.

Before, it absorbed passively. Now that it can actively absorb, no wonder it's growing so fast.

  Focusing her gaze, she noticed these pitcher plants had grown slightly taller in just a short while.

This Point Spirit talent is pretty intense.

At this rate, wouldn't the pitcher plants start producing nectar soon?

Lier's thoughts became excited.

  Once these pitcher plants mature, they'll inevitably produce seedlings.

  Expanding cultivation then would secure a stable sugar source.

  Sugar is a strategic resource even in modern times. In this world without a sugar industry, it's practically a luxury item.

  Establishing a large-scale sugar production industry would mean an endless stream of wealth, far more valuable than any gold or silver mine.

For the domain to develop in the future, external trade would be essential. Currently, Dawnveil City had little to offer in foreign trade. This would become its specialty!

  A treasure to be traded for vast resources!

His gaze fell upon Granny Green Grass, filled with admiration.

“Well done!!”

“Work to grow the pitcher plants as quickly as possible and encourage their reproduction. Our sugar production industry can begin construction starting now.”

  


Chapter 88 Demigods—Do They Even Have the Right to Call Themselves Gods Before Me? (5900 words)

Lier watched the pitcher plants swaying in the muddy soil, feeling quite pleased.

  These creatures truly lived up to being the creation of the Bog God—perfectly suited to his tastes.

“Cultivate these pitcher plants well and scale up production as quickly as possible. They will yield immeasurable value for us in the future.”

  Feeling his earnestness, Granny Green Grass’s gaze grew serious.

  This book is exclusively published by 𝕥𝕨𝕜𝕒𝕟.𝕔𝕠𝕞

  “As you wish, Father God.”

  They weren't skilled in combat, but when it came to cultivating plants, they considered themselves unmatched.

Lier spoke as she led the Green Grass Grandmothers to the fish farm, showing them the fishtail grass used to feed the Dragon Blood Red Fish.

  After observing for a moment, the leader of the Green Grass Grandmas stood up and said.

  “Father God, these fishtail grasses can only be cultivated into 1-star magical plants at most.”

  “If they're used as fish feed, the point of spirit activation isn't significant either.”

  Lier was pleasantly surprised.

  Whether or not they could be spirit-enchanted, cultivating them into 1-star magical plants was sufficient!

“Cultivate them as quickly as possible. Dragonblood red fish are more precious than pitcher plants, and these fishtail grasses are their food.”

After speaking, he felt a pang of regret.

  “It's just unfortunate we haven't found a way to breed Dragonblood Redfish yet.”

  Grass Grandma said solemnly.

  “Father God, I sense these fish lack energy. The fishtail grass we're feeding them now can't meet their needs.”

  Lier's gaze sharpened slightly.

  “Lacking energy? Could upgrading the fishtail grass grade compensate?”

“Certainly possible.”

Grass Grandma affirmed with certainty.

Lier's smile instantly deepened.

Unexpectedly, the root cause had been discovered through Grass Grandma!

  The leading Green Grass Grandma stepped forward, gently lifting the fishtail grass that poked slightly from the mud.

  She closed her eyes slightly.

  A faint green energy emanated from her body, enveloping the fishtail grass.

  In an instant, the surrounding magic seemed drawn like iron filings to a magnet, surging into the fishtail grass in her hand.

  After about five minutes, she carefully replanted the fishtail grass into the mud.

  Then an astonishing sight unfolded—the fishtail grass seemed to hit fast-forward, growing at an astonishing pace.

Beneath its stem, roots sprouted like tentacles, densely covering the muddy surface.

Within just ten minutes, the palm-sized plant had tripled in size.

  Only then did the magical energy surging around it gradually cease.

Lier, intrigued, opened the plant's attribute panel.

Fishtail Grass

Magical Plant

【Grade】: 1-star

  [Properties]: Rich in magical energy. Consumption rapidly replenishes nutrients essential for fish vitality.

[Evaluation]: These aquatic plants undergo special modification, significantly enhancing vitality and growth rate. Capable of rooting and growing on silt surfaces.

Just this simple upgrade made it a 1-star magical plant?!!

  Lier felt his horizons had broadened.

  He'd assumed the skill panel's “Cultivate Magical Plants” required prolonged, meticulous care, followed by careful selection, before any plant could qualify as magical.

  Who knew it could be achieved through direct magical conversion?

  Indeed, one cannot always apply common sense to the magical world—this realm defies logic itself.

Compared to the previous fishtail grass, it gained an additional trait—rapidly replenishing nutrients essential for fish survival.

You could say it's perfectly suited for the job.

  “Father God, for future feeding, simply cut off the leaves above the roots of the fishtail grass.”

“As long as their root systems remain intact, they'll regrow within half a month.”

“If scaling up is needed, you can propagate the fishtail grass by dividing the clumps.”

Lier nodded with delight.

  “I'll instruct you all to convert more and scale up production.”

The nine Green Grass Grannies immediately responded, each taking action. One picked up a fishtail grass plant and transformed it into a magical plant.

At this pace, it wouldn't take long to convert them all.

  Then, by propagating the plants, the area could be expanded exponentially.

His gaze shifted to the dragonblood red fish swimming in the water, large...


To my satisfaction.

These delicacies of the mortal world have finally found a way to be bred. Once we cultivate three to five hundred acres, we'll have more dragon blood red fish than we can eat.

Like the nectar-producing pitcher plants, these dragon blood red fish are another inexhaustible gold mine.

  Moreover, each fish holds greater individual value. If transportation challenges could be resolved, they'd make excellent trade commodities.

He summoned the fish farm staff, delegated the necessary tasks, and instructed them to coordinate further with Granny Green Grass to accelerate scaling up operations.

  With that settled, Lier paid a brief visit to the two-headed ogre chieftain.

Last night's battle against the Plaguefly General had plunged this unfinished Level 11 hero into a deep slumber.

His valiant, unyielding fight was beyond reproach.

  The only issue was his strength falling short.

The Swamp's Blessing no longer held sway. Now, like the Mud Queen Bee, he could only rely on his own fate.

Shaking his head without dwelling on it, Lier turned away to reassemble his forces.

  The night raid by the foul-smelling Lord of Flies' followers had placed immense pressure upon him.

The enemy had already discovered and attacked Dawnveil City, and this was merely the first wave.

Whether there would be a second or third wave, no one could say.

  He needed to seize greater power swiftly.

Fortunately, Hargus and the Flesh Slaughterer had awakened, bolstering his hand.

But if he could train even one or two squadrons of Coldblooded Cavalry, his position in this battle wouldn't be so passive. Strength was everything.

  The army assembled: four squadrons of Wetland Lizardmen Warriors, eight Bubble Beasts, and three Swamp Sirens.

All Mud Swamp Wasps were brought along as well.

  This time's target—↓30 kilometers south, the area overgrown with black tall grass, home to the followers of the foul-smelling, fly-ridden Lord of Filth, that wicked demigod.

  If they dared attack Dawnveil City, they'd have to be prepared to face the consequences!

  He never let revenge wait until tomorrow.

  Lier's gaze was cold.

After assembling his forces, he paused, then sent for Bain's granddaughter—the sole alchemist of Dawnveil City who had crafted a 3-star alchemical potion—

Doniya.

  Upon seeing Lier, the thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girl appeared quite shy.

  “Good day, Lord.”

  After a timid curtsy, she twisted the cloth bag in her hands, hardly daring to look at him.

  Lier gazed at the young girl and spoke slowly.

  “Doniya, you must know that last night, a group of vicious enemies attacked the domain.”

  “We lost dozens of warriors in this assault. This debt must be repaid. Blood for blood.”

  Doniya's face grew serious, her shyness forgotten as she handed over the cloth bag.

“My Lord, this is all the black-spotted bloodworm powder I've managed to produce these past few days.”

“Due to the limited supply of black-spotted red bloodworms, I haven't been able to make much more.”

  She hastily added.

“However, I've begun experimenting with breeding Black-Spotted Bloodworms. These insects grow remarkably fast, and by mid-next month, I should have a substantial batch.”

  The reproduction rate of these insects far surpassed that of ordinary lifeforms. A single egg-laying could yield thousands or even tens of thousands of offspring, rivaling fish in quantity while boasting a significantly higher survival rate.

Lier accepted the bag and nodded approvingly.

“Doniya, you've done an excellent job.”

  “Whatever resources you need, just ask Bain directly. We need to stabilize the production of black-spotted bloodworm powder.”

The potency of the 3-star alchemical potion had already been tested on the Level 13 Mosquito Queen.

And with the Bubble Beast's synergy, the effects could be greatly amplified.

  Preparing extra measures against those cultists of the dark gods was never a bad idea.

Hearing this, the little girl's cheeks flushed bright red as she nodded excitedly.

Receiving Lier's approval felt to her like the glory of a child winning first place in an exam and stepping up to receive an award.

  With preparations complete, the army set out immediately.

  Thirty kilometers was no short distance, but since most of the area had already been explored, their progress was swift.

  Midday.

  Scouts from the Wetland Lizardmen ahead relayed intelligence: an area overgrown with tall black grass had been discovered.

  Li


His gaze sharpened, and his spirits soared instantly.

He ordered the main force to hold their position while he led Hargus and two squads of Wetland Lizardmen in a stealthy approach.

  After ten minutes of progress through sparse woods, the view suddenly opened up.

A vast clearing stretched before them, its edges lost to the horizon.

The ground was blanketed in black, slender weeds that covered the entire expanse.

  Concentrating his senses, he could detect a distinct aura of malevolence emanating from the grass.

It felt like a field strewn with corpses and flesh, the black grass itself a vile entity nourished by blood.

  A sickening stench hung in the air—a pungent mix of blood and sulfur, nauseating to the point of vomiting.

Glancing around, the air felt eerily still, broken only by the faint rustling of grass and leaves stirred by a gentle breeze.

Even the usual chirping of insects and croaking of frogs seemed to have been silenced.

  Hargus suddenly seemed to sense something, his gaze fixed intently on the center of the black grass.

  “Master... those bastards are here.”

  “I can sense it—that sickening stench of flies!”

  Lier's eyebrows arched slightly.

  Her gaze swept the area, finding nothing.

She looked down at the grassy patch, deep in thought.

Her spirit dispersed outward. She summoned the power of the Swamp Goddess within her, enveloping herself in divine energy. Using a tree trunk for cover, she silently stepped forward.

  The next moment, the scene abruptly shifted.

The black grass vanished beneath her feet, replaced by a land covered in blood and severed limbs.

Above, strange, twisted hairs writhed in midair, resembling the fine hairs growing on a fly's legs.

  In the center, thousands of corpses knelt in a silent circle, faces turned toward the heart of the circle.

What was truly horrifying was the three-meter-long spatial fissure standing upright in the void above the center of those corpses.

It resembled a demon's eye.

  From the fissure, plague flies continuously emerged.

Below, their numbers had already swelled to over a thousand and kept growing.

Most crucially, he spotted three Plague Fly Generals!!

Lier drew a sharp breath, his gaze turning icy.

  Thankfully he had acted today. Had he been a moment later, the enemy forces would have gathered, and tonight would have brought a battle ten times more brutal than last night's.

Even if the Flesh Slaughterer completed its transformation, the cost would be unbearable.

He took a step back.

  The scene before him vanished instantly.

The view returned to the lush, black grasslands.

“Master.”

Hargus looked puzzled.

Lier said nothing more, waving for the accompanying warriors to return immediately.

  Only upon rejoining the main force did he regain his composure.

While pondering, he relayed all the intelligence to the army. Finally, turning to Hargus, he spoke with grave seriousness.

“Any outsider entering that area will be detected the instant they step inside.”

“Therefore, we have very few opportunities.”

  He had used the power of his divine essence to block their perception.

  But with hundreds of soldiers in the army, he couldn't protect them all.

  “Once the battle begins, you must eliminate those three Plague Fly Generals immediately. Can you do it?”

  Hargus's voice was low, his gaze unwaveringly resolute.

  “My Lord, the task shall be accomplished!”

  The Sovereign had granted him everything. If he couldn't fulfill this simple task, what right did he have to be Dawnveil City's blade?!

  What right would he have to cleave through every thorn in the Sovereign's path?!

  A lizardman would never betray such expectations!

  Lier nodded, his gaze growing colder.

  “Bubble Beast, ignite the Black Spot Bloodworm Powder. Use bubbles to trap the smoke.”

“Swamp Lizardfolk, heed my command. The moment the explosion sounds, prepare yourselves. When the Swamp Wasps launch their assault, charge together!”

  “Swamp Sirens, coordinate with the Wetland Lizardmen in the assault.”

The low-flying Swamp Wasps required no additional commands; a mere thought was enough to unleash their relentless, unyielding attack.

Using the Swamp Wasps' actions as a signal would better enforce his will.

  As Lier's voice faded, the army sprang into action.

Bubble Beasts ignited the Black Spot Bloodworm Powder, gathering bubbles to accumulate smoke.

Once the powder was fully consumed, each Bubble Beast manipulated twenty bubbles burning with thick fog.




  Eight people equaled 160 bubbles.

Over a hundred transparent bubbles, burning with thick smoke, floated around them, creating a truly spectacular sight.

With the prelude complete, Lier wasted no time, leading his troops to approach silently.

  It must be said that these cultists of the dark god were arrogantly overconfident, failing to station sentries around the perimeter of that dark expanse.

  Then again, if he hadn't been present, they might well have had grounds for such arrogance.

  With the army in position, Lier steered the Bubble Beast silently onto the black grassland.

  The scene shifted once more.

A carpet of flesh and blood spread across the ground, covered in twisted, grotesque fly-like hairs.

All the plague flies now focused their attention on the spatial fissure, which resembled a demon's eye.

They never imagined anyone would be bold enough to sneak inside.

  Divine aura enveloped Bubble Beast, though the bubbles trailing behind remained at the periphery.

Bubble Beast could manipulate bubbles up to two hundred meters in diameter, providing ample maneuvering space.

  Once they reached the 150-meter mark, the Bubble Beast signaled to Lier that they were within striking distance of the clustered Plague Flies.

Lier took a deep breath and decisively ordered the attack.

  Whoosh~

  The warriors waiting at the periphery suddenly saw smoke-filled bubbles hurtling into the dark grassland beside them.

  In the blink of an eye, the bubbles vanished.

  Their expressions turned puzzled.

  The gathered Plague Flies abruptly turned their heads in unison as the bubbles entered this realm of flesh and blood.

Their compound eyes flashed with icy murderous intent.

Who was it??

But upon seeing the bubbles, they were puzzled. Could attacks containing such a mere trace of magic truly harm them?

  Some flies darted out to intercept, but the bubbles, flying straight ahead, suddenly rose higher, soaring over these creatures incapable of great altitude.

They plunged toward the dense crowd. The remaining flies tried to stop them, but it was too late.

  They could only watch helplessly as the bubbles crashed into their midst and exploded.

Boom~ Boom~ Boom~

Ear-splitting explosions erupted one after another, sending shockwaves rippling through the air.

  The oppressive fog within instantly shattered, spreading across the entire space with the shockwaves.

Caught off guard, the plague flies were tossed by the blast, coughing violently as toxic mist filled their lungs.

  Then, everything before their eyes twisted into distortion, while an overwhelming urge to destroy surged within them.

  Black Spot Bloodworm Powder Properties——

  Inhalers lose their minds and attack nearby life forms with frenzied rage. After the poison's effects subside, their hearts cease beating and blood vessels explode.

  The unprepared Plague Flies fell victim en masse.

They lunged at their own kind, snapping jaws and curled stingers plunging viciously.

The scene instantly turned bloody.

Monsters began slaughtering one another.

  The most frenzied was a stricken Plague Fly General.

  Struck head-on by a bubble, it exploded instantly, inhaling an incalculable amount of toxic mist.

  Now wielding a long-handled double-bladed battle axe, it rampaged wildly, slaughtering all around.

  No Plague Fly could withstand its blades. The scene grew intensely bloody.

Lier watched from the rear, his heart pounding.

He'd only intended to disrupt their formation with the alchemical potion—never expecting such devastating results!!

  The pestilence flies' flapping wings acted like giant fans, rapidly dispersing the thick fog as they clashed.

When the mist had thinned to harmless levels, the swamp lizardmen warriors suddenly saw the swamp wasps darting out like arrows.

  Highly alert, they immediately followed suit, stepping into the black undergrowth.

But when the swamp lizardmen warriors saw the scene before them, their faces froze in utter bewilderment.

The enemy they now faced was nearly wiped out, with fewer than two hundred remaining on the field.

  And they were still locked in fierce combat with each other.

One of last night's ferocious and arrogant Plague Fly Generals now lay fallen, while two others teetered on the brink of collapse.

What on earth was happening?

Amidst their confusion, the swamp wasps, with their superior flight speed, had already reached the center of the battlefield.

  Their sharp stingers tore exaggerated gashes, injecting deadly venom into their bodies.

They hunted down every last remnant of the enemy.

By the time the Wetland Lizardmen warriors reached the scene, only two Plaguefly Generals remained on the field.




  Hargus charged forward astride his ferocious Wyvern, holding nothing back as he unleashed his full power!

  Two severely weakened Level 12 heroes fell before Hargus's blade, each struck down with a single blow that severed their heads.

  This surprise attack ended abruptly in a way no one could have anticipated.

  The Wetland Lizardmen hadn't even engaged their foes before it was over.

When Lier arrived, Hargus held the severed head of a Plaguefly General in one hand.

“Master, the enemy has been completely annihilated.”

  Lier nodded, paying no heed to the rest. His gaze immediately fixed upon the void fissure, which resembled a demonic eye.

He could sense an extremely malevolent aura emanating from that crack—a sensation nearly identical to what he had felt last night when the Plague Fly General summoned the demi-god's will.

  At that very moment, the fissure trembled faintly before slowly widening into a crimson pupil.

A faint blood-red energy surged forth, enveloping the entire Blood Flesh Domain.

Surrounding warriors felt a chill run down their spines, as if fixed in the gaze of a malevolent dragon, their breathing becoming labored.

  Hargus clenched his steel blade tightly, his eyes fixed on that crimson orb.

Danger. Extreme danger!!

Every cell in his body screamed warning.

  “You vile blasphemer! How dare you defy the Great God?!”

“You... cannot escape.”

“I shall drag you back, drain every drop of blood from your body, and use your soul to fuel the furnace.”

  “This land belongs only to me!”

A voice of fury, deep as rolling thunder, emanated from the crimson pupils. It carried an eerie, hollow quality, as if traversing the river of time itself.

The sense of impending doom surged to its peak in that instant.

  The Lord of Blood and Flies was now enraged beyond measure. His struggle against another demigod had drained his strength.

He had finally discovered the Prime Material Plane, gaining vast resources that had allowed him to barely regain his footing.

And now, inexplicably, a mere human had disrupted everything!!

  How dare he?!!

Just a moment's inattention today, and the power he'd channeled over had been completely purged by the other party!!

Without the resources of the Prime Material Plane, that damned vampire would tear him to shreds!!

  But after his roar, he saw that human lord, under the gaze of the blood-red eyeball suspended in midair, step by step, approaching and reaching its base.

The other slowly lifted his head to look. Not a trace of fear marred his strikingly handsome face.

His tone was indifferent.

  “Lord of Filth and Flies, you sewer-dwelling vermin! Who gave you the audacity to bark at me?!”

“A demigod dares call himself a god in my presence?!”

The Lord of Filth and Flies exploded with rage!!

  A mere human, a lowly crawling insect not even reaching level 10, dared to show such contempt?!

Damn it, damn it!!

In his fury, colossal power surged into the eyeball.

  This eyeball was his true eye, possessing the power to connect realms—the very means by which he had stepped into the Prime Material Plane.

The surging energy made the eye glow with a blinding crimson light.

  Just as he prepared to crush that damned human across planes with his supreme power,

he suddenly sensed a faint blue energy emanating from the opponent. Then, the human slowly extended his right hand, curling his palm as if plucking fruit.

In that instant, blue light enveloped his eyeball.

  The next instant, his vision plunged into pitch blackness.

An indescribable agony surged through him.

His consciousness snapped back from the Prime Material Plane, instinctively clutching his eyes.

Green blood dripped wildly.

  The Lord of Blood and Flies lowered his hand, examining the bloodstains. He sensed the hollow void and excruciating agony in his right eye socket.

  His mind was filled with utter disbelief and shock.

  “How is this possible? How?!”

  “That damned human... he actually plucked out my eyeball?!!!”

  He was a demigod! How could that bastard possibly harm a demigod?!!!

 


Chapter 89: Massive Rewards (4800 words)

Lier clutched the pulsating crimson eyeball in her hand, her eyes burning with intensity.

  He could distinctly sense the immense energy contained within it, like a suppressed volcano poised to erupt at any moment, spewing scorching magma tens of thousands of feet high.

  The Swamp Godhead radiated boundless divine might, firmly suppressing its opponent.

  He hadn't expected the Lord of Filth and Flies to be so reckless—daring to send his own eyeball to the Prime Material Plane right before his eyes.

If the Lord of Filth and Flies had descended in his true form, Lier's current power would have been insufficient to harm him.

  But the fatal flaw lay in this—the enemy had sent his eye across an entire plane.

Wasn't this like delivering the goods right to his doorstep?!

Existences above demigod were repelled by the main plane's laws and could not descend.

  This eyeball possessed utterly overwhelming power against ordinary beings.

How immensely powerful were demigods?!

Destroying mortals across planes was child's play.

But he wasn't mortal. He wielded the ultimate power—divinity!

  How could a demigod compare to a true god?!

The eyeball, now clutched in his hand, had shrunk to the size of a human skull—crimson, malevolent, reeking of blood.

It evoked an intense sense of unease.

Lier's excitement was beyond words.

  This single eyeball alone made today's operation bloody profitable!!

  Feeding it to the Flesh Slaughterer might awaken even greater power!

  He took several deep breaths, forcing down his inner turmoil, and glanced around.

  “Hargus, you oversee the cleanup. Bring back everything of value.”

The eyeball remained restless in his grasp. He could faintly sense the Lord of Filth and Flies summoning it frantically.

The slightest relaxation, and it might tear through the void at any moment.

  Better return soon to digest it, lest night brings endless dreams.

The surrounding swamp lizardmen warriors remained frozen in shock.

Gazing upon Lier, who held the crimson orb in one hand, radiating solemn authority, their eyes burned with intense desire.

  They had witnessed Lier plucking that demonic eye—a conduit between planes—right out of thin air!

That ferocious, powerful being, a terrifying presence that had nearly robbed them of breath, had offered no resistance whatsoever as its eyeball was ripped out alive!!

What overwhelming ferocity was this?!!

  This was their master!!

  If one could observe their faith meters, it would reveal that the earliest followers of Lier had already reached maximum capacity.

Meanwhile, the newly arrived Wetland Lizardmen, having not witnessed Lier's various feats before, were struck by an even more profound shock. Their inner reverence surged at an exaggerated rate.

  Following the strong is the innate nature of all life.

After Hargus's stern rebuke, the swamp lizardmen snapped back to reality, swiftly clearing the battlefield with eager hands and feet.

Body after body was collected and sealed within bubbles.

  Amidst the bustle, Lier suddenly noticed the pulsing in the eyeball in her hand had ceased.

  The intense call had vanished as well.

  Had the Lord of Filth and Flies given up?

  Just as she pondered this, the intelligence system in her mind quietly revealed new information.

  【You forcibly extracted the eye of the Evil Demigod—Lord of Stench and Flies—and suppressed it with absolute power, causing it to permanently lose this eye imbued with demigod strength. You gain an additional intelligence report—the land beneath your feet is a special treasure controlled by the Lord of Filth and Flies: the Crimson Flesh Rot. Travel to its center and use your divine power to delve 20 meters underground. There, you can directly erase the Lord of Filth and Flies' soul imprint and seize control of this Crimson Flesh Rot.】

  Lier stared at the newly refreshed intelligence, thrilled beyond measure.

  The Lord of Filth and Flies had indeed abandoned it. Now he could safely claim it as his own.

  Moreover, the very ground beneath his feet was also a treasure?

This was beyond belief.

Without the intelligence, he would never have considered such a possibility.

His interest piqued, he turned to survey his surroundings. After a brief estimation, he quickly located the center point.

  It lay not far from the spatial fissure that had just appeared.

He strode forward and came to a halt.

Summoning the Swamp Godhead within him, a surging, sacred, and inviolable power erupted.

It plunged deep into the flesh-and-blood mud. In an instant, he discovered a sphere of flesh and blood, condensed with a unique force.




  Without a moment's hesitation, the divine power violently pierced through.

The flesh-and-blood sphere twisted violently, erupting into a hysterical roar.

“Damn bastard, damn you!!!”

“I'll make you—”

  The shrill scream abruptly halted. Lier gave the Lord of Filth and Flies no chance to roar.

He brutally dispelled the power the other had imprinted on the flesh sphere, branding his own mark upon it.

  The instant the mark formed, his senses abruptly expanded.

  As if granted a god's-eye view, he could now perceive the entire expanse of this scarlet, rotting flesh domain.

  This flesh-and-blood realm formed an irregular circle, roughly twenty meters deep and spanning a radius of three hundred meters.

  Composed entirely of rotting corpses.

Beneath the surface, he could sense bones and skulls scattered everywhere.

He couldn't fathom how many lives had to be slaughtered to create such a terrifying realm of death.

  As he marveled, a unique attribute panel appeared in his mind.

  Crimson Flesh Domain

  【Level】: Special

  【Range】: 300-meter radius

  【Properties】: 1. Upon standing within the domain, all attributes increase by 50%.

  2. Devour Flesh: Consuming flesh expands the domain's radius.

3. Gathering Evil: Abundant malevolent energy attracts powerful dark entities, which may become guardians loyal to the domain's master.

  4. Flesh Prison: Summons a crimson cage formed from rotting flesh to imprison enemies. The prison remains indestructible as long as the domain's energy persists.

  【Evaluation】: An evil entity born from the Abyss, forging this dreadful domain from hundreds of thousands of corpses.

  After reviewing its attributes, Lier's heart skipped a beat.

  Four traits?! And not a single one is useless.

  More crucially—this Flesh Realm can actually continue growing.

  And seemingly without limit.

The Lord of Foul Odor and Flies was practically a gift-bearing messenger.

Lier now harbored immense goodwill toward that demigod. The fellow was far too generous—he could send divine artifacts, dragon eggs, or whatever in the future. He wouldn't turn them down.

  Taking several deep breaths to steady her surging emotions, she focused her intent.

The surrounding swamp lizardfolk suddenly felt the space around them ripple like water.

The crimson earth before their eyes gradually faded, then vanished entirely.

  Turning to look around, they found themselves standing on ordinary ground covered in short grass.

It was as if the terrifying scene they had witnessed moments before had been a figment of their imagination.

Indeed, the Crimson Flesh Wastes were not fixed to the earth. Like other treasures, they could be moved and carried away.

  Lier sensed the crimson rotten flesh land coalescing within his mind, and the curve of his lips gradually lifted.

Unbelievable! Absolutely unbelievable!!

Hahaha.

In future battles, he could simply unfold this terrifying land and instantly gain home-field advantage.

  Moreover, he sensed there were still many unexplored possibilities within it.

  The potential was limitless.

  In high spirits, he saw the army had already gathered the corpses and didn't linger.

  He waved his hand and headed back.

  He casually stuffed the crimson eyeball into the now-empty cloth sack.

  The smile on his lips refused to fade throughout the journey.

  This ambush had truly paid off handsomely.

  First, it had eliminated the second wave of crisis brewed by the Lord of Stench and Flies.

  Had he left them unchecked, their forces would have gathered. By nightfall, he couldn't imagine what might have unfolded.

Perhaps a dozen Plaguefly Generals would have emerged, leading armies of thousands upon thousands of Plagueflies to besiege Dawnveil City.

That would have been a tragedy.

  Fortunately, his preemptive strike had nipped this threat in the bud.

  The second gain—over a thousand corpse flies.

  This too was a rich haul.

  The corpses were crucial to him, having become an essential resource. Their utility was immense, applicable in countless directions.

Third, the eyeball of the Lord of Foulness and Flies.

This eyeball had been torn from the demigod's body while it still lived, imbued with the power of a demigod!!

  The power within surged like a tidal wave.

Feeding it to the Flesh Slaughterer might just push it to the next level.

Awesome.

The fourth was the hand.


The Crimson Fleshlands.

A land capable of growth, endowed with formidable properties—this signifies boundless possibilities for the future.

  All in all, this battle yielded a bountiful harvest, and the price he paid? Merely some Black Spot Bloodworm Powder!

Compared to the gains, it was utterly insignificant.

This was how combat should be.

  What a satisfying feeling.

But this hunt wasn't without its problems—this strike merely suppressed a latent threat temporarily.

After this battle, the Lord of Filth and Flies would surely hold back for a while. Yet when he struck again, it would be earth-shattering.

  That demigod had already fallen to him twice, sacrificing his own eye and the prized Crimson Fleshland.

He harbored a deep, seething hatred.

Given the chance, he would spare no effort to exact vengeance.

The resentment of a demigod was not something to be taken lightly.

  Preparations must be made.

At this thought, the excitement in Lier's eyes dimmed slightly.

But his gaze turned icy cold once more.

Given time to grow stronger, revenge? He'd tear apart the foul-smelling Lord of Flies' lair itself!

  His only enemy was time.

Dawnveil City's rapid growth bolstered his confidence.

The journey passed without incident. Only when the stars once again filled the sky did the army return to the domain.

Bain, who had been slightly worried, breathed a huge sigh of relief upon seeing the main force return. He hurried forward to greet them.

  “Good evening, my lord.”

Lier nodded, briefly recounting the day's battle before his voice grew solemn.

“The domain must remain vigilant henceforth. The Lord of Filth and Flies will seek vengeance.”

  “We must be prepared. We cannot afford complacency.”

Bain's expression immediately grew grave.

The vengeance of a demigod?!

He instantly felt immense pressure, yet his gaze hardened with resolve in an instant.

The look he gave Lier brimmed with fervent confidence.

  Under the Lord's leadership, he was certain no enemy could ever harm Dawnveil City!

This was the madness and adoration born of victory after victory.

  “My Lord, with you here, no one can destroy our domain!”

Lier gave the Swamp-Folk hero a deep look.

“With your collective efforts, I too am convinced!”

After a few parting words, he did not dwell on the topic.

  He gestured toward the bubbles filled with corpses nearby.

“These bodies will be used to cultivate Coldblooded Cavalry. We need a higher-tier army.”

Bain surveyed the vast harvest filling the pits, a smile spreading across his wrinkled face.

“As you wish.”

  Lier then dismissed the troops to rest.

He led Hargus to the enclosure housing the young lizards.

The bubble beasts unloaded the corpses.

By the thousands, they piled up into a small hill.

  His gaze fell upon ten specially selected, heavily armored Wetland Lizardmen warriors standing nearby.

“Each of you may choose one young lizard to be your future companion.”

“I shall grant you a career change to become Coldblooded Cavalry.”

  “I've witnessed every feat you've accomplished. I won't shortchange a single brave warrior!”

These were the warriors who had followed Lier from Loran City to this day.

Each had earned glorious military honors.

They deserved the first rewards.

  Several Wetland Lizardmen immediately became overcome with excitement, their eyes burning with fervor.

For lizardmen, the Coldblooded Cavalry held profound significance—much like griffins to humans—serving as a spiritual totem.

  Transitioning into a Coldblooded Cavalryman was the ultimate aspiration every lizardman dreamed of achieving.

  After expressing their gratitude repeatedly, they immediately entered the enclosure and began selecting carefully.

  The palm-sized young lizards appeared largely indistinguishable, and he made his choice swiftly.

Hargus, observing this, strode forward and explained the method for their class change.

He then used his own blood to form a special lizard rune, which he fused onto a corpse.

  The chosen lizards immediately pounced, devouring it voraciously until nothing remained.

Once the lizards ceased feeding, the Wetland Lizardmen...


The warrior immediately slashed his palm open, feeding them with his blood.

Swallowing the blood, the young lizards' eyes instantly turned crimson as they began a new round of devouring.

  With ample flesh and blood, it would take only two to three days for them to evolve into true killing machines—Swift Ferocious Lizards.

These Wetland Lizardmen would also share in this life force, gaining even more ferocious combat prowess.

  With Hargus's example before him, Lier harbored high hopes for the Coldblooded Cavalry.

Having settled matters here, he strode briskly toward the swamp treant.

Beneath the trunk, the slumbering flesh-slaughterer lay utterly still, like a corpse long dead.

  No heartbeat, no breath, and no head.

He pulled open the sack and retrieved the crimson eyeball.

Compared to the one he'd extracted from the Plaguefly General yesterday, the power contained within this one was in an entirely different league.

  The moment the eyeball appeared, the Flesh Butcher seemed to sense something. Its body trembled, then it pushed itself up with both hands and slowly rose to its feet.

  The headless torso turned toward Lier.

  That formless gaze, like the sun itself, fixed intently upon him.

  “Master. I sense an even more potent demi-god aura.”

  Lier smiled cheerfully, extending the crimson eyeball in his hand.

“This is the eye I extracted from that demigod.”

The Flesh Slaughterer paused slightly, then its formless gaze grew intensely fervent.

  “Master, I sense this eye holds exceptionally unique power. If I devour it, I have a fifty percent chance of seizing that demigod's strength!!”

Seize the opponent's power?!
And with a fifty percent chance?
Lier found it quite unbelievable.

  This guy... he's pretty fierce.

After all, that's a demigod—not just some random cat or dog.

Coming to his senses, he inexplicably felt that the Lord of Blood and Flies was like livestock he kept, ready to shear a fleece from him at any moment.

  He handed over the eyeball.

  “Very well. Thus, I bestow it upon you.”

  “Thank you for your bounty.”

  The Flesh Slaughterer's voice brimmed with delight. He could sense this eye would catalyze his next transformation.

  The next instant, the crimson eyeball seemed to lose all gravity, floating upward and flying directly toward the Flesh Butcher.

Deep red energy surged forth, enveloping the eyeball. Tentacles coalesced, tugging the eyeball toward his body.

  The eyeball seemed to sense something, erupting with fierce energy as it frantically tried to retreat.

  But against absolute force, its struggle was futile.

  Dragged by the crimson tentacles, it was pulled toward the chest.

The moment it touched the skin, the stitched flesh ripped open, swallowing the eyeball whole.

A massive bulge appeared on the chest. After a few breaths, it gradually subsided, returning to stillness.

  In that instant, the Blood Slaughterer's previously serene aura crashed like a collapsing mountain into the sea, unleashing towering waves.

Ferocious energy surged.

An invisible pressure radiated outward from its center.

  In that instant, every soul in Dawnveil City whipped their heads toward this direction, terror filling their eyes.

  Cold sweat instantly drenched their backs.

  That pressure, seeping into souls and piercing bloodlines, made their entire bodies tremble uncontrollably.

  In the fish farm, the crimson dragonblood fish thrashed wildly, their tails churning up vast splashes on the water's surface.

  Further away, at the pig farm, three boars bellowed frantically, trying to break free from their pens.

  Fortunately, that terrifying aura lasted only a few breaths before gradually receding.

Otherwise, that pressure alone could have plunged the entire domain into utter chaos.

When all returned to stillness, the flesh-devouring creature before them completed its final transformation.

  This terrifying entity—three meters tall, headless, its flesh and blood seamlessly stitched together—knelt on one knee.

  With the most humble posture, it paid homage:

  “My Lord, I thank you for your grace. From this day forward, your lowly servant shall be at your command.”

  Lier smiled with satisfaction at this sight.

  After investing so much, the moment of harvest had finally arrived!

  With boundless anticipation, he opened the attribute panel of this divine being.

  Flesh Slaughterer

  Divine Being




  Talent: Immortality, Divine Immortality grants self immortality.
